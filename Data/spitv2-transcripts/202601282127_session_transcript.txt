interviewer: Just to make sure we're on the same page, can you confirm that you're here today because you're experiencing fear and anxiety about your skiing career following the recent race?

patient: That's exactly right. The race I lost a few weeks ago—it just feels like a sign that I can't keep doing this. I've always pushed hard, but now every training session feels like a struggle. My head's clouded with what-ifs, and it's hard to focus. Even though I recovered from my past injury, this feels different.

interviewer: It sounds like this shift in perspective is really impacting your ability to train effectively. Are you comfortable moving forward with our session today?

patient: Yes, I want to work through this. I'm just... really anxious about everything right now.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that anxiety with me—it's completely valid given what you're going through. Before we dive in, can you tell me if you have any questions about how today’s session will work or what to expect?

patient: Honestly, I just want to know what this process looks like. Will we be talking about the race specifically? I’m worried my mind might shut down if I focus too much on it, but I know I need to work through this.

interviewer: I understand your concern about focusing on the race. We can approach this gradually. Will you be comfortable if we start by discussing the race and your thoughts about it today, while keeping our focus on what feels manageable for you?

patient: I guess so... discussing the race might bring up a lot of stress. The pressure from that race, and the arm injury before, it all feels like it's closing in.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness so far, Luke. To better understand patterns, have you experienced similar feelings of anxiety or fear about your skiing career in the past?

patient: No, this is the first time I've felt anxiety like this around skiing. I had an arm injury before, which was tough, but I never lost confidence the way I have after this last race. It's like everything feels different now—bigger, more overwhelming.

interviewer: It sounds like the recent race has brought up a lot of uncertainty for you. Who in your life has been most supportive during challenging moments like this in the past?

patient: My coach has been the most supportive during tough moments. After my arm injury, they helped me rebuild confidence in my training and stayed patient as I worked through the physical and mental challenges. They’ve always framed setbacks as part of the journey, which helps me try to see this loss as something similar… even if it’s harder this time.

interviewer: It’s clear your coach’s support has been meaningful. Can you tell me about any current stressors or challenges you're facing in your life right now?

patient: The biggest stressor is this constant fear that my career is over, even though logically I know I’ve recovered from injuries before. Every time I try to train, I’m haunted by the recent race—I keep replaying it, wondering if that’s the end. The pressure to perform feels heavier now, like the injury and the loss are this cloud I can’t shake. It’s making it hard to focus on practice, and I’m scared I’ll just quit if I don’t figure this out soon.

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of your past injury and recent race loss has been really challenging. Have you faced any other significant challenges or traumatic experiences that might be contributing to how you're feeling now?

patient: No, the main challenges have been the recent race loss and my past arm injury. I’ve always pushed myself hard in skiing, but this feels different—like the pressure and fear are piling up. My family is supportive, but I’ve kept this anxiety to myself because I didn’t want to burden them. I guess the sport itself is so high-stakes, and I’ve always tied my identity to competing, so this feels like a bigger shift than I expected.

interviewer: It’s understandable how deeply tied your identity is to skiing, and how this shift feels so significant. What do you think has helped you navigate challenges in the past, like your recovery from the arm injury?

patient: Well, after the arm injury, I think staying focused on the physical therapy and setting small goals helped. My coach and physical therapist had a clear plan, and I just followed it step by step. My family’s support also made a difference—they’d remind me to take it slow. But this feels different because there’s no broken bone to heal… just this fog in my head that won’t clear.

interviewer: I want to check on your safety. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself in any way since your anxiety started?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts about ending my life. The fear has been overwhelming, but it's more about losing my career and identity than self-harm. I get stuck replaying the race in my head, but I haven't considered anything like that.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Luke. It sounds like the anxiety is deeply tied to your identity as a skier. Let’s move to another area—have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns recently? For example, feeling unusually restless or needing less sleep than usual?

patient: Yes, I’ve been restless at night—my mind replays the race over and over, so I either stay awake late or wake up early. I’ve also been drinking more coffee than usual to stay alert during training, but it doesn’t feel like it’s helping much.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Luke. It’s clear how much this anxiety is affecting your focus and rest. Let’s touch on another area—have you been using any substances like alcohol, cannabis, or other medications beyond your coffee intake? And have you noticed any changes in that use recently?

patient: I don’t use anything beyond coffee, maybe a beer or two occasionally when I’m out with friends. But since the race… I’ve been avoiding alcohol. It feels like I need to stay sharp for training, and I don’t want anything clouding my head right now.

interviewer: Thank you for explaining your alcohol use, Luke. It’s understandable to want to stay focused during training. Have you noticed any periods recently where you feel unusually energetic, restless, or need very little sleep—maybe even taking risks you wouldn’t normally take?

patient: No, I haven’t felt unusually energetic or restless lately. If anything, I’ve been struggling to sleep because my mind won’t stop replaying the race. I try to focus on training, but it’s harder when anxiety keeps me up at night.

interviewer: It’s understandable how anxiety can disrupt sleep and focus, Luke. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently—such as hearing voices, believing others are targeting you, or feeling intensely suspicious about things that seem unrelated?

patient: No, I haven't experienced anything like that. It's more like... intense anxiety and fear about skiing, you know? Just racing thoughts about my career ending, not... strange perceptions or suspicions. I’ve always been able to tell what’s real, even when it feels overwhelming.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying that, Luke. To ensure we cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies—prescription, over-the-counter, or otherwise? This includes things like pain relievers, vitamins, or anything you take daily.

patient: No, I'm not currently taking any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies. I used to take ibuprofen occasionally for training-related soreness, but not regularly—just as needed. Since my last injury healed fully, I haven’t needed anything beyond that.

interviewer: Thank you for explaining your current routine, Luke. To ensure we’re thorough, do you have any other medical conditions or concerns—such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or past head injuries—that might be relevant to how you’re feeling now?

patient: No, I don’t have any of those medical conditions. My current issues are more related to the stress and anxiety from the skiing situation—like trouble sleeping sometimes, but it’s not something I’ve been officially diagnosed with.

interviewer: Thank you for being so open, Luke. It sounds like your coach and family are important supports for you. Can you share more about what resources or people you rely on when you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed? This could include family, friends, hobbies, or other coping strategies.

patient: My coach has always been a big support, especially after setbacks. They helped me reframe losses before, but lately, I’ve been avoiding talking to anyone about this. When I’m overwhelmed, I’ll sometimes push through training harder, like if I focus on the physical routine it might quiet the anxiety. But even that feels harder now. I haven’t reached out to my family yet—I’m worried they’ll worry or think I’m overreacting.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety stems from a mix of factors: your identity as a skier (predisposing), the recent race loss (precipitating), and ongoing worries about career sustainability and avoidance of support (perpetuating). Your coach’s support and past resilience are protective factors. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re pretty spot-on, but I’d add the sleep issues and caffeine reliance as part of how the anxiety’s taken hold. Also, the pressure from competition itself—like constantly fearing another injury or another bad race—might be part of the cycle. The coach’s support is there, but I haven’t leaned on it lately, which probably makes things worse.

interviewer: Thank you for adding those details—they’re important pieces of the puzzle. Now that we’ve reviewed the factors contributing to your anxiety, what would you like to prioritize next in our sessions? For example, addressing sleep patterns, refining coping strategies for competition pressure, or exploring ways to reconnect with your coach’s support?

patient: I think the sleep issue is something I need to work on—those restless nights are making everything worse. Also, maybe we could focus on rebuilding my confidence for training and races? I used to have strategies with my coach, but now I feel stuck in this loop of fear.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those priorities. To ensure we’re aligned, our next steps would focus on addressing sleep patterns and rebuilding confidence through structured strategies. Is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust before we move forward?

patient: I think that covers it. But maybe… could we also touch on how I tie my identity to skiing? It’s not just about the career—it feels like losing part of who I am. I’m scared that if I can’t race, I’ll have nothing left.

interviewer: Thank you for raising that—it’s important we address how your identity is intertwined with skiing. Let me recap: your anxiety stems from career fears (precipitated by the recent race loss), ongoing sleep and focus issues, and the deep connection between your self-worth and skiing. Your coach’s support and past resilience are strengths. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re accurate about the main points, but maybe you missed the part about how I’m replaying the race constantly at night—makes it hard to sleep, and I’ve been drinking more coffee to stay alert during training. Also, I haven’t told my family how bad it is; I’m scared they’d push me to quit. And… the anxiety feels different this time. With the arm injury, I knew I’d bounce back, but now it’s like there’s no ‘fix’—just this fog that won’t lift.
