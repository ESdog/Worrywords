interviewer: May I have your preferred name and pronouns, Courtney?

patient: Sure, I’m Courtney. You can use she/her pronouns for me.

interviewer: Courtney, just to clarify, today’s session will involve discussing your current concerns and how we can work together to address them. We’ll take things at your pace, and you can ask questions at any time. Does that sound comfortable for you to proceed?

patient: Yes, that sounds okay. I’m a little nervous, but I want to work through these feelings. The past few days have been really heavy, so talking about it might help.

interviewer: It's completely normal to feel nervous—thank you for taking this step. Before we dive in, is there anything specific you'd like to ask about how today’s session will go or what to expect?

patient: No, but I appreciate knowing how we can address the family tension and improve my self-worth. I just want to feel like I'm not the problem in the family.

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like the incident with your parents really intensified these feelings of being the worst sibling. What are your hopes or goals for coming to therapy?

patient: I hope therapy can help me understand why I feel like I’m failing as the oldest sibling and how to stop comparing myself to others. I also want to learn how to set boundaries without making things worse at home.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing your goals—I appreciate your courage in seeking help for such personal struggles. Can you tell me a bit more about when these feelings of being the worst sibling first started and how they’ve changed over time?

patient: It really hit me a few months ago when my parents got into a big argument about something I said. Since then, I’ve felt like I’m constantly letting the family down, and it only gets worse when things get tense at home.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing how challenging it must be to feel like you're constantly letting your family down. Can you describe what these feelings look like in your daily life—do they show up as anxiety, sadness, or something else? For example, have you noticed changes in your sleep, appetite, or concentration when tensions arise at home?

patient: It’s mostly anxiety that builds up when things get tense at home. I’ll catch myself replaying conversations in my head, wondering if I said or did something wrong, which keeps me up at night. My concentration at work has slipped a bit lately—I’ll space out during meetings, then feel guilty for not being ‘present’ like I should be as the oldest.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like family dynamics play a big role in how you see yourself. Have you experienced any other challenging or difficult situations in your life that might be contributing to these feelings of being the 'worst' sibling?

patient: Honestly, I think it goes back to childhood. My parents always said the oldest should be the role model, so I felt like I had to be perfect in everything—grades, behavior, even how I treated my siblings. Even when I messed up, I’d blame myself more than they did. But it’s gotten worse lately. Like, when my younger sister got into trouble last week, I ended up apologizing to my parents for her instead of letting her take responsibility. It’s just... it’s hard to explain, but I feel like I’m the one keeping the family together sometimes, and that weighs on me.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that—I can see how carrying so much responsibility must feel incredibly heavy. Have you experienced similar feelings or situations in the past where you felt this way about yourself or your family role?

patient: Not really, but I’ve always felt this quiet pressure to be perfect as the oldest. Before yesterday, I could usually push through it... but now it’s like the pressure cracked into something bigger. I keep wondering if I’ve been failing them my whole life, even when things seemed okay.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of these expectations has been building for a long time. Have you experienced similar feelings of being the worst sibling or intense pressure to be perfect in the past, before this recent escalation?

patient: The pressure to be the oldest and set an example has always been there, but the recent yelling incident made these feelings feel *constant*. Before that, I guess I could push the comparisons aside sometimes... but now even small conflicts at home trigger the 'worst sibling' thought loop. It’s like the bar keeps getting higher, and I’m always falling short.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of emotional weight for a long time. Have there been any other experiences in your life—perhaps in childhood or adolescence—that might have contributed to these feelings of needing to be perfect or taking on more responsibility than others in your family?

patient: Yes, I think growing up, I always felt I had to be the responsible one. My parents often looked to me to set an example, and I guess I internalized that pressure. I remember mediating arguments between my siblings a lot, which made me feel like I had to keep everything together… even when I was struggling myself.

interviewer: It sounds like you've carried a lot of emotional weight for your family while managing your own struggles. Have there been any other experiences in your life—perhaps in childhood or adolescence—that might have added to the pressure of needing to be perfect or take responsibility for others?

patient: I think it started when I was younger. I always felt responsible for my siblings, like I had to be the perfect example. My parents expected a lot from me, and if something went wrong, it was usually my fault. I remember trying to fix things when they fought, but it never worked.

interviewer: It sounds like you've shown a lot of resilience in navigating these challenges. Have there been any other difficult or traumatic events in your life—such as major losses, abuse, or other stressors—that you think might be connected to these feelings of needing to be perfect or taking on family responsibilities?

patient: I don't think there were other major traumatic events—I haven't really thought of anything else like that. The pressure of being the oldest has always felt heavy, but the recent argument with my parents really made me question everything. I guess I never saw it as 'trauma,' just... constant stress.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing so openly—your willingness to reflect on these patterns is a strength. Have you experienced times in the past where you felt similar pressures or emotions, and if so, what, if anything, helped you cope back then?

patient: Honestly, this is the first time these feelings have felt this overwhelming. Before, I’d catch myself comparing myself to my siblings, but I just pushed through by reminding myself to be the ‘good older sister’—you know, working harder to prove I was responsible. When there were minor arguments, I’d avoid bringing up my feelings to keep the peace. But lately, even that doesn’t help, and the guilt feels constant. It’s like the pressure’s always there, even when I’m trying to breathe.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I want to make sure we address your safety. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life, even if you didn't act on them?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts of harming myself, but I do feel overwhelmed at times. I've never seriously considered suicide.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty. To better understand your current state, have you used alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances recently, even occasionally?

patient: No, not recently. The stress has been overwhelming, but I haven’t turned to anything like that—just replaying conversations in my head and losing sleep instead.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. It’s understandable how stressful situations can take a toll. Have you ever experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, perhaps taking on more projects than usual or feeling more irritable than normal?

patient: No, I don’t think so. My energy levels have felt more...drained lately, especially after family conflicts. The irritability I feel is tied to my anxiety about failing expectations, not from being overly energetic. I’ve always been a restless sleeper, but it’s because my mind races, not because I feel ‘hyper.’

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying that. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don’t, or have persistent beliefs that others are watching or following you?

patient: No, I haven’t heard voices or seen things others don’t. But… sometimes I feel like my parents and siblings are constantly judging me, especially when I’m trying to be perfect. It’s more like they’re always *noticing* me, even when I’m just doing my best.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that sense of being judged—it sounds like a heavy burden to carry. Have you been taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins regularly, including over-the-counter ones, that you’d like to mention?

patient: No, I haven’t been taking any medications or supplements. I’ve tried to eat better lately, but nothing else. It’s mostly the emotional stuff that’s been wearing me down.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. It’s understandable how stress can lead to physical symptoms like fatigue. Have you noticed any other medical concerns, such as issues with your thyroid, chronic pain, or other conditions that might affect your energy levels or mood?

patient: I don’t think so, but I haven’t had any check-ups recently. I’ve been focused on family stress, and what I notice is just... exhaustion and my head racing, like my thoughts won’t quiet down. My sister says I stress-eat, but I don’t count that as a ‘medical’ issue. I’m worried I’m overreacting when there’s no real physical cause here.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress of family expectations has been especially heavy lately. What have you found helps you cope, even in small ways, when these feelings become overwhelming?

patient: When it gets too bad, I’ll sometimes write down my thoughts in a journal to not keep replaying them in my head. It helps a little, but the guilt still lingers. I also try to remind myself that I’m doing my best, even if it doesn’t feel enough… though that’s easier said than believed.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Courtney, based on our conversation, it sounds like lifelong pressure to be a perfect role model, compounded by recent family conflicts, has created a cycle of self-blame and anxiety. This pattern is perpetuated by avoiding conflict and overcompensating, while your journaling and self-compassion are strengths we can build on. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: I think you captured the pressure and self-blame well, but maybe missed how fresh the recent parent incident feels—it’s still raw, like it happened yesterday even though it was a few days ago. Also, I didn’t mention how the work stress compounds it; when I’m distracted by family guilt, I make small mistakes at work, which then feeds the ‘I’m failing everyone’ loop. Oh, and the part about my siblings—when they try to reassure me, I hear it as pity, not genuine support, which makes me withdraw more.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those important details—understood that the recent incident feels freshly distressing, work stress exacerbates self-criticism, and siblings’ reassurance feels dismissive. Would you like me to revise any part of the summary based on this? If not, what would be most helpful for us to focus on next (e.g., strategies for work-family balance, exploring sibling communication patterns)?

patient: I think the summary is accurate—I just want to clarify that the work stress isn’t separate from the family pressure, it’s all tangled up for me. Maybe we could explore sibling communication patterns first? I want to understand why reassurance feels invalidating and how to set boundaries without guilt, but I’m also open to work-life balance strategies if that unifies the stressors. Either way, I need to stop replaying conflicts endlessly and feel like I’m not responsible for everyone’s expectations.

interviewer: I appreciate you clarifying how work and family stress intertwine—I’ll ensure we connect those threads in our focus. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust about how we’ve framed your experience so far?

patient: I think you’ve captured the main points well—I especially appreciate acknowledging the cycle of guilt and hypervigilance. Maybe adding how I sometimes avoid family gatherings altogether to escape the pressure, even though it makes me feel more isolated? It’s like I’m punishing myself for fearing I’ll ‘mess up’ again. Otherwise, the framing feels accurate—I’m ready to dig into breaking that cycle.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that additional layer about avoiding family gatherings—it’s clear how much self-punishment is tied to your fear of failing others. Let’s build on this foundation: what would you like us to prioritize first in breaking this cycle? For example, exploring how to reframe siblings’ reassurance, practicing boundary-setting, or developing strategies to manage work-family stress without self-criticism?

patient: I think managing the self-criticism first would help—I need to stop linking every family stressor to personal failure. Maybe learning to separate my worth from their reactions could free up energy for setting boundaries later. The guilt over work focus is a good example: if I can trace that to perfectionism, maybe tools to interrupt that cycle would help calm my racing thoughts.

interviewer: It makes sense to prioritize addressing self-criticism as a foundational step before tackling boundary-setting. Before we finalize our plan, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust about how we’ve framed your goals and next steps?

patient: I think focusing on self-criticism first is right, but maybe adding how my guilt affects work? Like, I overanalyze emails or meetings now, thinking I’m failing there too. Also, maybe address how I fear setting boundaries will make my parents see me as ungrateful—it’s like I’m scared to ‘rebel’ against their expectations even when it’s healthy. Can we keep checking if the strategies fit with my need to feel responsible for my siblings’ well-being, even as I learn to let go?

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those important nuances about work guilt and boundary-setting fears—they’ll be crucial to integrate. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience in this summary?

patient: You captured the pressure of being the oldest and the family tension well, but I think you missed how recent this feels. The incident with my parents happened *yesterday*, which makes the whole thing feel more acute and raw. Also, the part about constantly needing to *justify* my actions to siblings—even when they’re not even upset—adds to the pressure. I mentioned replaying conversations in my head, but it’s not just anxiety; sometimes it’s like I’m mentally rehearsing apologies I haven’t even made yet. Oh, and I think I downplayed how much I avoid family gatherings now because the anticipation of being criticized exhausts me more than the actual arguments.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying how recent the parent incident feels and the added pressure of preemptively justifying actions to siblings—it’s clear how much anticipation and self-punishment are entangled here. Let me confirm our focus: we’ll start by addressing self-criticism and work-family stress, while exploring how to reframe siblings’ reassurance and set boundaries. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience in this plan?

patient: That captures the main things, but maybe you didn’t mention how I keep replaying the argument in my head even when there’s no conflict—like my brain won’t let me stop judging myself. Also, the part about preemptively apologizing… I do that at work too now, like I’m bracing for criticism everywhere. It’s not just family anymore.

interviewer: I appreciate you highlighting how self-judgment and preemptive apologizing now extend beyond family into work settings—it’s clear how this pattern amplifies your sense of failure. Let me frame a brief model to check: *Predisposing factors* include lifelong perfectionism and role as family mediator; *precipitating* was the recent parent incident; *perpetuating* is the thought loop of self-criticism and avoidance of family gatherings; *protective* are your journaling and self-compassion efforts. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience in this model?

patient: I think your model is mostly right, but I’d say the ‘perpetuating’ part might miss how much I still *actively seek reassurance* from my siblings/parents even though it doesn’t help. Also, the pressure to mediate family dynamics isn’t just a role—I physically avoid family gatherings now to ‘escape’ the stress, which makes me feel even more like I’m failing at being part of the family. Oh, and the chronic exhaustion from sleepless nights *does* affect my work focus, which loops back into my ‘imperfect’ self-judgment. Did I say that already?
