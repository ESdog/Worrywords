interviewer: Hello Naomi, thank you for coming in today. Can I start by asking if there's a specific name or pronouns you'd like me to use?

patient: Hello, my name is Naomi Vaughn. I use she/her pronouns. Thank you for asking.

interviewer: Thank you, Naomi. To clarify, this session will involve discussing your thoughts and experiences related to your current concerns, and we’ll work together to explore ways to support you. Do you have any questions about how this session will work or what we’ll discuss today?

patient: No, I think I understand. I just hope we can figure out how to help me not feel so stuck. I’ve been focusing on cars for so long that I don’t know where else to start, and it’s making me avoid things at work and with friends too.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It sounds like this has been really challenging for you. Does that sound okay with you, or would you like to adjust anything before we begin?

patient: ...

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It sounds like this has been really challenging for you. Does that sound okay with you, or would you like to adjust anything before we begin?

patient: Yeah, that sounds about right. Maybe the part about how long it's been going on—I think it's been more like two years, not just 'a few.' Also, I did try taking on a small project at work last year but ended up handing it off to someone else because I was sure I'd mess it up. Still, the summary captures the main stuff. I guess that's okay to start with.

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I appreciate your openness in sharing these challenges, Naomi. It sounds like this pattern has been quite persistent. Could you describe what your mood or energy levels feel like during these moments of self-doubt or avoidance?

patient: I feel really drained, like my energy just... leaves me. It’s not just sadness—it’s more like a heavy, restless anxiety that makes my head feel foggy but my body can’t move. Like I’m watching myself from outside, thinking I should do something, but it’s all just... too much. It’s worse when I’m at work, even now, just talking about it makes my chest tighten.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings are really affecting your work and daily life. Can you tell me when you first noticed these patterns starting, and if there was a specific moment or event that made them feel more unmanageable over time?

patient: I think it started around when I first got promoted to my current role in marketing. At first, I was excited, but the more responsibilities I had outside of car-related tasks, the more I doubted myself. There was one time last year when my team asked me to lead a social media campaign—it wasn’t about cars, though. I said yes at first, but as the deadline neared, I kept convincing myself I’d mess it up. Eventually, I handed it off to a coworker. That moment felt like a turning point; after that, I just started avoiding anything that didn’t directly involve cars, even if it meant saying no to opportunities.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that turning point—it takes courage to reflect on moments that challenge our confidence. What are you hoping to achieve through this counseling process? What would ‘getting better’ look like for you?

patient: I want to stop feeling like I’m only good at cars and learn to trust myself in other areas. ‘Getting better’ would mean being able to take on new projects at work without panicking, maybe even trying a hobby again without fearing I’ll ‘fail.’ I’d also like to not feel so... isolated when meeting new people, you know? Like, if I can’t convince myself I’m capable, I’ll keep pushing everyone else away too.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I appreciate your openness so far, Naomi. To better understand your experiences, have you faced any past situations or challenges—like difficult relationships, major life changes, or traumatic events—that might be connected to these feelings of self-doubt or avoidance?

patient: I don’t recall any specific traumatic events or major life changes that stand out, but my self-doubt really intensified after my promotion to a leadership role in marketing last year. I suddenly felt like I had to prove I could handle responsibilities beyond cars, and that pressure made me freeze up when asked to lead a social media campaign. Handing it off felt like a failure, but taking it on felt impossible. It’s been hard to shake that feeling since.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing so openly about the challenges you've faced at work and in social settings. Have you ever had thoughts of intentionally hurting yourself or ending your life?

patient: No, I haven’t had thoughts of intentionally hurting myself or ending my life. But there are days when the weight of feeling stuck and unqualified for anything outside of cars feels overwhelming. It’s hard to describe—it’s like my anxiety makes me want to shut down mentally, but I haven’t let it go that far.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to prove yourself in your new role has been really draining. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or energy levels lately? For example, have you been sleeping more or less than usual, or feeling unusually energetic?

patient: Yes, I've been struggling with sleep. I often lie awake at night worrying about work tasks I'm avoiding, which leaves me exhausted by morning. My energy feels... sluggish, like there's this fog I can't shake, especially after work hours. It's like my brain won't stop replaying the things I'm afraid I'll mess up.

interviewer: It sounds like your sleep and energy patterns are quite disrupted right now. Have you ever experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even when stressed—like you couldn’t slow down or focus?

patient: No, I don’t think so. When I’m stressed, I usually feel the opposite—like I can’t sleep at all, but even then, my mind feels foggy and stuck. I remember times when I’d lie awake for hours, replaying work stuff, but I never felt ‘energized’ or unable to slow down. It’s more like my brain is racing but I can’t move forward with anything.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about how stress affects your sleep and energy. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances in the past year, including for recreational or self-medication purposes?

patient: No, I haven’t used any substances like that. I know it’s not a good idea to self-medicate, but I’ve just been trying to push through the anxiety on my own. It’s hard when every new task feels like a setup for failure, though.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing your efforts to manage without substances—it takes strength to seek healthier coping strategies. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts that feel real to you, even if they might not make sense to others?

patient: No, I haven't experienced anything like that. My main struggles are with self-doubt and avoiding things that make me feel unqualified. I just can’t shake the fear that I’ll fail at anything outside fixing cars, even if it’s something simple like leading a team project.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those details. I’d like to check if there are any medications, supplements, or other substances you’re currently taking—prescribed, over-the-counter, or herbal. Could you walk me through what you’re using regularly, if anything?

patient: I’m not currently taking any medications or supplements. The only thing I’ve had recently is the occasional cup of coffee in the mornings, but I don’t drink it often because I notice it makes my anxiety worse. I’ve never been prescribed anything for this before.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been managing without substances or medications, which shows your commitment to finding healthier coping strategies. Before we move forward, I’d like to briefly check if there are any medical conditions or physical health concerns—like thyroid issues, chronic pain, or sleep apnea—that might be contributing to or interacting with what you’re experiencing. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like that?

patient: No, I haven’t been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues or sleep apnea. My main struggles are with self-doubt and avoiding challenges, not physical health problems. I do have trouble sleeping sometimes when I’m stressed, but it’s not chronic or officially diagnosed.

interviewer: What did I miss?

patient: The core issue seems to be the belief that I'm only good at working on cars, which started affecting me after my promotion in marketing last year. I avoid new responsibilities and social interactions because I’m afraid of failing outside that area, and it’s causing a lot of anxiety and sleep problems. I think that's the main thing driving everything else right now.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. Based on our conversation, it sounds like your belief that you're only skilled in working on cars has been growing since your marketing promotion, leading to avoidance of new tasks and social interactions. This avoidance seems to fuel anxiety and sleep issues, which in turn reinforce your self-doubt. Your strengths include seeking help and recognizing patterns, and we could build on that by exploring strategies to challenge these thoughts. What did I miss?

patient: You didn’t mention how the anxiety feels physically—like being stuck in my head with this constant heavy fog, yet my body won’t move to escape it. Also, pushing people away isn’t just work; I cancel plans with friends, too, because I’m scared they’ll see how ‘unqualified’ I am and stop liking me. It’s like… I’m waiting to be found out.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those important physical and social dimensions, Naomi. It sounds like the anxiety you're describing isn't just in your mind—it's showing up in your body and relationships in very real ways. What did I miss?

patient: I think you’ve captured the big picture, but maybe you didn’t ask how this affects my *daily routine* outside of work. For example, even simple things like trying a new recipe or joining a friend for a walk feel impossible if they’re not car-related. I’ll cancel plans last-minute or zone out during conversations because my mind is stuck replaying ‘what if I fail?’ It’s like I’m constantly mentally preparing for disaster in areas I don’t even care about—cars are the only thing that feels safe, even if it’s lonely. Also, I haven’t mentioned how guilt feels when I push people away… it adds to the fog, but I don’t know how to fix it.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those important details about your daily life and the emotional weight of pushing people away, Naomi. It sounds like your connection to cars is both a refuge and a source of isolation, while guilt compounds the difficulty of engaging with others. Let me try to piece this together: Your belief that you’re only skilled in cars (predisposing) was challenged by your recent promotion (precipitating), leading to avoidance and anxiety (perpetuating). Your openness to seeking help and recognizing patterns are strengths (protective). What did I miss?

patient: I think you hit the main points, but maybe you missed how my sleeplessness—lying awake worrying about messing up—keeps the anxiety going, even when I want to try new things. Also, my friend Jess is a good listener, but I haven’t told her about this car thing, partly because I’m scared she’ll think I’m stuck in a dead-end thing… or worse, that I’m not capable of growing. That silence probably makes the isolation worse, too.

interviewer: Thank you for highlighting those important aspects of sleep and social connection, Naomi. It sounds like your sleeplessness and fear of judgment from Jess are key parts of the cycle we’re trying to break. Before we move forward, I’d like to make sure we’re aligned—does this summary reflect your experience accurately? What did I miss?

patient: You captured the sleep issues and the fear of judgment part okay, but you missed that the promotion to leadership last year was a key trigger. Also, there’s no ‘Jess’—I don’t recall mentioning anyone by that name. The social media campaign I avoided was with a team I don’t really click with, but I haven’t named them yet. And the part about pushing people away… that’s true, but it’s mostly because I feel like a fraud when I’m not fixing cars.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying the promotion as a key trigger and the team dynamic around the social media campaign. Before we finalize our next steps, let’s briefly check if there’s anything else about your experience we haven’t covered that feels important. What did I miss?

patient: I think I didn’t mention how my parents always praised me for my car skills growing up—they’d say things like, ‘You’re a natural at fixing engines, that’s your gift.’ But whenever I tried arts or school projects, they’d just laugh and say, ‘That’s not your strength.’ It made me equate being good at something with car work, and anything else felt like a stretch. Also, when I failed a school presentation in middle school, my mom joked, ‘See? Stick to mechanics,’ and I’ve carried that like a warning ever since. It’s why branching out feels like proving them wrong.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that history with your parents—it adds important context to how your self-worth became tied to car skills. Let me synthesize this all: Your lifelong pattern of being praised for car skills while other efforts were dismissed (predisposing) collided with career demands in marketing (precipitating), creating anxiety, avoidance, and social withdrawal (perpetuating). Your courage to seek help and recognize these patterns is a strong foundation (protective). What did I miss?

patient: Thanks for putting it so clearly. You didn’t mention how the anxiety keeps me up at night—I’ll lie awake for hours worrying about failing at something simple, which makes me foggy and exhausted during the day. Also, I have a close friend I confide in, but I haven’t shared these specific feelings with them yet. I’m not sure how to explain this without sounding… broken.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying the sleep impact and your hesitation to share with your friend—those are crucial pieces. Let me try one final summary: Your lifelong association of self-worth with car skills (predisposing), amplified by recent leadership demands in marketing (precipitating), has created a cycle of anxiety, sleep disruption, and social withdrawal (perpetuating). Your openness to growth and self-awareness are key strengths (protective). What did I miss?

patient: I think you captured the core, but maybe missed how my car passion is separate from my marketing job—I worked in auto sales before, and that’s where the confidence came from. Now, marketing feels 'fake' compared to that. Also, I haven’t told my friend how much this is affecting me; I’m scared she’ll think I’m overreacting about something ‘so small.’

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying your auto sales background and the unspoken worry about how your friend might perceive this. Before finalizing our next steps, is there anything else we haven’t covered that feels important to share? Once we’re aligned, we can discuss how to begin addressing these patterns together.

patient: I guess I should mention that I worry people see me as ‘just’ good with cars and not capable in other areas—it makes me feel... small. Also, I haven’t told my friend how I’m really feeling yet because I’m scared they’ll think I’m weak or that I’m overreacting. It’s hard to ask for help when I already feel like I’m failing.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those vulnerable thoughts about feeling 'small' and the fear of being judged by your friend—those are important pieces. Before we finalize our next steps, is there anything else we haven’t covered that feels important to your experience? Once we’re aligned, we can discuss how to begin addressing these patterns together.

patient: I guess the one thing I haven’t mentioned is how my car obsession actually started when I was younger. My dad used to let me watch him fix his old pickup, and I got really good at it real fast. Now, whenever I try to do anything else, like gardening or painting, I can’t shake the feeling that everyone’s comparing me to ‘mechanic Naomi’—like I’m less capable if I’m not wrenching on something. It’s… it’s kind of embarrassing to admit, but it’s been a wall I can’t climb over.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Reports persistent self-doubt, avoidance of non-car-related tasks/work responsibilities, and social withdrawal for ~2 years post-promotion to marketing leadership. Describes anxiety as 'heavy, restless fog' with physical symptoms (chest tightness, sluggish energy). Sleep disrupted by ruminating about work, leading to exhaustion. Feels 'stuck' in car-related identity, fearing judgment for 'failing' outside this domain.

Objective: Avoidance of professional/social opportunities, impaired work performance (e.g., delegated project to coworker). History of parental reinforcement of car skills as primary strength, dismissing other interests. Auto sales background contrasts with current marketing role. No suicidal ideation, substance use, or psychosis. Close friend relationship unburdened by disclosure.

Assessment: Chronic anxiety and avoidant patterns likely linked to identity rigidification around car skills, exacerbated by career transition. Parental messaging ("stick to mechanics") and middle school failure may contribute to maladaptive self-worth framework. Risk factors: sleep disturbance, social isolation; protective factors: self-awareness, motivation for growth.

Plan: CBT to challenge car-centric self-concept, explore family dynamics' role in identity formation, and build tolerance for uncertainty. Sleep hygiene education. Gradual exposure to non-car tasks/social interactions. Monitor anxiety-avoidance cycle. Consider family therapy exploration if relevant.
