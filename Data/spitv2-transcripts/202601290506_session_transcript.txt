interviewer: Hi Erik, could you share your preferred name and pronouns with me?

patient: My name is Erik, and I use he/him pronouns.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing, Erik. Can you confirm that you're comfortable proceeding with today's session as we begin to discuss what's been bringing you here?

patient: Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I want to get through this... but I'm kinda nervous talking about all of it. My hands are shaking a little, honestly.

interviewer: It's okay to feel nervous; we'll take things at your pace. Can you let me know if you have any questions about how today's session will go before we start?

patient: I don’t think I have any questions right now. I’m just… a little nervous, but I want to get through this. I guess I’m hoping we can figure out why I can’t stop worrying about whether my boyfriend really loves me. It’s been taking up so much space in my head, even at work, where I’m supposed to be focusing on code.

interviewer: It's completely normal to feel uneasy about these conversations, Erik. Can you confirm that you understand today's session will focus on exploring your concerns about your relationship and how they're impacting your daily life, with the goal of understanding them better together?

patient: Yeah, I get that. I guess I’m here because I can’t stop worrying he doesn’t really love me, even when we’ve been together five years. It’s messing with my job and just… everything else.

interviewer: It sounds like this fear has been really affecting your work and relationship. Can you share more about what might have contributed to these feelings starting around six months ago?

patient: I think it started when he got this big project at work six months ago. He’s been working late, coming home exhausted, and we just don’t talk as much as before. At first I told myself it was just the project, but… when he’d zones out during our evenings together or cancels plans last-minute, I start thinking maybe he doesn’t love me anymore. I’ve tried bringing it up, but he says he *does* love me, and that just… makes me doubt myself more. I guess I crave hearing it more often, but it feels like I’m nagging now.

interviewer: It sounds like trying to communicate your needs has left you feeling both vulnerable and unheard. What are your hopes for how counseling might help with these challenges?

patient: I guess I want to understand why this fear won’t go away, even after years together. I’ve tried talking, but it feels like I’m hitting a wall… so maybe counseling can help me figure out if it’s something *I’m* doing, or if there’s a way to bridge this gap. I don’t want to keep doubting every text he sends or every time he’s busy at work—it’s exhausting.

interviewer: It sounds like this uncertainty is taking a real toll, and it’s brave to want to explore it. What have you found helpful or unhelpful in managing these worries so far?

patient: Talking to my boyfriend has been unhelpful because it just makes me feel worse when he can’t reassure me the way I need. My best friend listens, but they don’t understand how to fix the fear—it just swirls in my head until I can’t focus on coding anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like your best friend’s support helps with listening, but not with calming the fear itself. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or moments when the anxiety feels especially intense beyond when your boyfriend is working?

patient: No changes in my sleep yet, but the anxiety feels worse in the evenings when we’re physically together but not really talking. Like, if he’s scrolling on his phone or just quiet, my mind starts spiraling. It’s like I need constant proof he’s paying attention, but even then, I still doubt it. My hands actually get shaky sometimes during those moments.

interviewer: I want to make sure I understand all factors that might be influencing this. Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant challenges in your life that could be connected to these feelings of insecurity in your relationship?

patient: No traumatic events come to mind, but I’ve always struggled with needing constant reassurance to feel secure. Before my boyfriend, I dated someone who was emotionally distant, and I think that left me more reliant on verbal affirmations. But with my current partner, it’s different—he’s not distant, just… really focused on his work lately. The problem is, I can’t shake the fear that his busyness means he’s pulling away, even when he says he isn’t.

interviewer: It sounds like your need for verbal reassurance has been a long-standing part of your relationships. Can you share a bit about your family dynamics growing up? Were emotional expressions of love or reassurance something that was common in your household?

patient: My family wasn’t really expressive with emotions. My parents worked a lot, so most of the love I felt was through things they did—like making sure I had everything I needed—but they weren’t the type to say ‘I love you’ much. I guess I always felt like I had to prove I was ‘okay’ to get their attention. Now, with my boyfriend, I crave those three little words, but it’s scary to ask for them because I don’t want to seem… weak. But part of me thinks if I don’t hear them, I’ll never be sure.

interviewer: I want to ask about your substance use to better understand your current health. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances in the past month, including for stress relief or to help with sleep?

patient: No, I haven’t used any substances in the past month. I’ve been trying to focus on work and my relationship, but I get really anxious sometimes—like last week when I couldn’t sleep after another quiet evening with my boyfriend. I just... I don’t want to risk my job or health by doing anything reckless. My hands are still shaking a little, though.

interviewer: I want to check in on your safety. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently? If so, could you share how often these thoughts occur, whether you have a plan, and what supports help you stay safe?

patient: No, I haven’t had thoughts of harming myself or ending my life. My main struggle is the anxiety and fear around my relationship, which feels overwhelming at times, but I haven’t reached that point. I’m here for help because I want to work through these feelings and improve my mental state.

interviewer: Have you noticed any recent changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns, such as needing less sleep or feeling unusually restless?

patient: Yeah, I’ve been having a hard time sleeping. I’ll lie awake for hours at night, my mind just going over the same worries about my boyfriend. Even when I do fall asleep, I feel like I wake up just as tired. My body feels restless, like I’m constantly wound up, and I don’t have as much energy during the day. It’s making it even harder to focus at work.

interviewer: I hear how exhausting this restlessness and worry must be for you. Have you experienced any periods of feeling unusually energetic or having a lot of ideas recently, even without much sleep? This helps me check for patterns of mood shifts.

patient: No, I haven’t had those kinds of energy spikes. When I’m stressed, I actually have trouble sleeping—my mind races with what-ifs about my relationship. Sometimes I’ll lie awake for hours, replaying conversations or wondering if I’m ‘reading too much’ into things. It’s more like restless overthinking than feeling energized.

interviewer: I want to check if there are any medications, supplements, or vitamins you're currently taking that might affect your mood or anxiety? This includes over-the-counter items or things you take for sleep/stress.

patient: I don’t take any medications, supplements, or vitamins right now. I’ve never needed anything like that before, and I haven’t tried anything for the anxiety or sleep issues—it just hasn’t felt like the right step yet.

interviewer: I want to check for any other experiences that might affect your thinking. Have you noticed any times when you hear voices, see things others don’t, or have thoughts that feel unusual or paranoid? This helps me understand if there are any patterns in how your mind processes stress.

patient: No, I haven’t experienced hearing voices or seeing things that others don’t. My thoughts are mostly about my relationship—like fearing my boyfriend’s love isn’t real—but they don’t feel ‘paranoid’ in a strange way. It’s more... constant worry, not hallucinations. I just feel insecure, not like my mind is breaking.
