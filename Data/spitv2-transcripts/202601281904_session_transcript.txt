interviewer: It sounds like feeling ashamed makes it hard to reach out, but you're here now to work on these thoughts. Do you feel comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: Yes, I suppose I do want to try... It’s just hard to talk about all this. I’ve never needed help like this before, but... if I don’t figure out how to stop these thoughts, I’ll lose everything I’ve been working toward.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Patty. Would you like me to briefly explain how these sessions typically work and what we might focus on today?

patient: Yes, I think that would help. I’m a bit nervous, honestly, but I really want to figure out how to stop these thoughts from consuming me. I guess I’m used to handling things on my own, but this feels bigger than me.

interviewer: Thank you for your honesty, Patty. In these sessions, we’ll typically explore your thoughts and feelings together, identify patterns, and develop strategies to manage them. Would you like me to clarify anything about this process before we begin?

patient: No, that sounds good. I just... I hope I don't come off as too much. Everyone at the community college says counseling helps, but I’m scared people will think I’m weak for needing it.

interviewer: It’s completely normal to feel that way, Patty. Would you like to ask any questions or share anything specific before we begin working on these thoughts together?

patient: Thank you for understanding. I guess I’m just really scared that this one failure means I’ll never graduate, even though I’ve worked hard. It’s hard to shake the thought that I’m not good enough, even when my friends try to reassure me.

interviewer: It’s clear how much this means to you, Patty. Before we begin working on these thoughts, is there anything else you’d like to ask or share to help you feel more comfortable starting?

patient: I guess... I’m worried that talking about this will make people think I’m not capable. I’m used to handling things on my own, but this feels different. My job at the store is stable, but trying to balance school has added so much pressure—like I’m failing at everything.

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like this failure has really shaken your confidence, Patty. Can you tell me if these feelings of hopelessness and anxiety have been constant since the test, or have they come and gone at times?

patient: They’ve been pretty constant, honestly. Even on days I try to focus on work or other stuff, the worry creeps back in—like when I look at my class schedule or grades. It’s worse at night when I’m lying awake, replaying everything. I can’t shake the feeling that one more mistake will make it impossible to finish.

interviewer: It sounds like these worries are really weighing on you, especially at night and when thinking about your classes. Can you share what you’re hoping therapy will help with most right now? What are your main goals for coming to counseling?

patient: I guess... I want to stop feeling like this one failure defines my whole future. The biggest thing is learning not to let these catastrophic thoughts take over when I study or even think about work. I’ve been so afraid to ask for help because I worry people will see me as weak, but I’m tired of being paralyzed by the fear that I’m going to lose everything I’ve worked for. I also want to sleep better—my mind won’t quiet down at night, and I end up replaying the test over and over. Maybe therapy can help me break this cycle of self-doubt so I can actually focus on passing my classes instead of just spiraling.

interviewer: It takes courage to share how much these fears weigh on you. When you feel overwhelmed by these thoughts and can’t reach out to others, what do you usually do to try to manage?

patient: When I can’t talk to anyone, I usually just isolate myself more, like staying up late to clean my apartment until my hands hurt. It’s the closest thing to feeling in control, but it just makes me more exhausted. Sometimes I’ll even go to work early just to avoid being alone with these thoughts, even if my shifts are already so tiring.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It takes courage to reach out for help, Patty. Can you share a bit about your family history or any significant experiences during your childhood that might relate to how you handle stress or challenges now?

patient: My parents were really strict about doing well in school and work. I always had to be the best, and if I messed up, they’d get really upset. So now, when I fail, I feel like I’m letting everyone down, even if they’re not around anymore. I guess I never learned it’s okay to make mistakes—just to push through them.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy burden of expectations for a long time. Can you tell me about any strategies or strengths you've used in the past to cope with challenges, even if they feel small or imperfect?

patient: I guess I always tell myself to just push through, like I do at work. If something’s hard, I figure I’ll outwork it, you know? But this time... it feels different. The test failure just proved I’m not good enough, no matter how hard I try. I’ve been cleaning the house nonstop to keep my hands busy, like if I’m doing *something*, maybe the panic won’t take over. But honestly? It’s not working like it usually does.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to maintain independence and meet expectations is taking a toll, especially when self-care becomes a source of guilt. Have you experienced any other difficult or traumatic events in your life that might be influencing how you cope with stress or perceive failures?

patient: I don’t think I’ve had any major traumatic events—I’ve always tried to handle things on my own, even as a kid. But… growing up, my family had a lot of financial struggles. We didn’t have much, so I learned early to take care of myself and not make mistakes that could waste opportunities. Now, when I mess up, it feels like I’m letting everyone down all over again. That’s probably why failing the test hit me so hard. I guess I’ve always tied my worth to being able to provide and succeed without relying on others.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It takes courage to reach out despite feeling ashamed—thank you for sharing that. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life, even if only in passing?

patient: No, I haven’t. I’ve never even considered it, honestly. But sometimes when I’m overwhelmed, I feel like... I don’t know, the weight of it all is so heavy. I just can’t picture going that far. My mind races with failures, but not that kind of thoughts. Mostly I just want this anxiety to stop.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Have you noticed any periods lately where you feel unusually energetic, restless, or need very little sleep, perhaps leading to impulsive decisions or racing thoughts that are hard to control?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced that. Actually, the opposite—lately I’ve felt drained most of the time. The only times I feel energy are when I’m obsessing over my mistakes or cleaning nonstop to distract myself, but it’s exhausting and doesn’t last. My mind feels stuck in a loop of worry, not racing thoughts.

interviewer: Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances recently, including for self-medication? How about prescription medications or supplements?

patient: No, I haven’t used any substances or medications for self-medication. I’ve tried over-the-counter sleep aids occasionally, but they didn’t help much with my anxiety.

interviewer: Have you experienced any hallucinations, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or sensing things that aren’t there? Or do you have thoughts that someone is out to harm you or that things happen to you on purpose?

patient: No, I haven’t heard voices or seen things others don’t. But sometimes I feel like my thoughts are so loud and overwhelming, it’s hard to focus. I just keep replaying the test in my head and worrying about everything going wrong.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements on a regular basis besides the occasional sleep aids you mentioned?

patient: No, I’m not taking anything else right now. The sleep aids I mentioned are just something I’ll take occasionally when the anxiety gets really bad at night. I haven’t been prescribed anything else, and I’ve tried to avoid meds as much as possible, even when my hands were cracking from cleaning so much—it felt like something I had to handle on my own.

interviewer: It’s important we identify what helps you feel grounded during difficult moments. What supports or activities help you cope when things feel overwhelming, besides talking to friends?

patient: When I get really overwhelmed, I start cleaning nonstop—scrubbing floors, wiping counters, anything to keep my hands busy. It helps me not think about the test... or anything else. Sometimes I'll stay at work later than I should just to avoid being home alone with my head. The noise and routine of the store keep me from spiraling, even though I'm exhausted afterward.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Let me briefly recap: Your recent academic failure triggered intense anxiety and catastrophic thoughts, worsened by lifelong perfectionism and fear of judgment. Compulsive cleaning and overworking temporarily ease panic but now disrupt your sleep and self-care. We’ll start with cognitive strategies to challenge self-defeating beliefs and improve sleep hygiene. What did I miss?

patient: You didn’t mention how my fear of letting people down ties into my childhood financial struggles—I grew up believing mistakes meant I’d fail everyone. Also, I’ve been using sleep aids, but they don’t really help me relax... the worry just keeps looping even when I’m exhausted.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that—understanding how childhood experiences shape current fears is crucial for our work. Let me summarize a tentative formulation: Your lifelong perfectionism and fear of failure (predisposing factors), triggered by recent academic stress (precipitating), are now maintained by avoidance, compulsive behaviors, and self-criticism (perpetuating). Protective factors include your resilience, peer support, and courage to seek help. Does this align with your experience, or would you add/correct anything?

patient: That... that makes sense, really. I think the part about tying my self-worth to success comes from my parents, who always stressed that you're only as good as what you accomplish. The interviewer didn't mention how growing up poor made me afraid of *letting people down* too—not just failing myself. Like, if I mess up, it’s like I’m a burden again... but I guess the formulation still hits the main points. Thanks for getting that part about the cleaning and avoidance behaviors. I hope this way, we can work on those automatic fears when they pop up at night.

interviewer: Thank you for adding those important details about your childhood and sleep challenges. Let’s plan next steps: We’ll prioritize cognitive strategies to untangle catastrophic thoughts, practice grounding techniques for nighttime anxiety, and explore healthier sleep routines. How does this align with what you need, or is there something else you’d like to address first?

patient: That sounds like what I need, but I’m scared the thoughts will still feel too loud at night even with grounding techniques. My hands get raw from cleaning to distract myself, but it’s not working anymore. Maybe we could also talk about how to stop linking every mistake to my whole worth? I keep hearing my dad’s voice in my head saying failures mean I’m not trying hard enough, even though he’s gone now.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the fear of letting people down and the lingering parental voice—you’ve highlighted how deeply these beliefs are rooted. What did I miss in our discussion so far, or is there anything else you’d like to add before we finalize our next steps?

patient: I think what’s maybe under the surface is how my job at the grocery store feels like a double-edged sword right now. It grounds me, but the long shifts drain me so I can’t focus on schoolwork. I worry I’m failing both… and that my coworkers might notice I’m distracted. Also, the sleep aids I occasionally take just make me groggy the next day, so I feel trapped in this cycle of tiredness. Oh, and I guess I haven’t mentioned how much I miss my parents—despite their strictness, I’d give anything to hear them say, ‘We believe in you.’

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those important nuances about your job and the emotional weight of missing your parents. Let me update our summary: Your grocery store job provides grounding but drains energy needed for school, while sleep aids create a cycle of grogginess. The longing for parental validation adds to the emotional strain. Is there anything else I’ve missed in this updated picture, or are we ready to finalize next steps?

patient: You captured most of it, but maybe the shame part. I worry people will think I’m weak for needing counseling, even though I know it’s not. Also, my job helps me feel normal but it’s hard to keep up with schoolwork when I’m so tired. I don’t want to seem like I’m making excuses, but... it’s all just so much.

interviewer: Thank you for highlighting the shame you feel around seeking help—that’s a significant barrier to overcome. What else might I have missed in this picture, or is there anything else you’d like to add before we finalize our plan?

patient: One thing I haven’t mentioned much is how my job at the grocery store adds to the pressure. I work early mornings, which leaves me exhausted for classes, but I can’t afford to cut back hours. It feels like every part of my life is pulling me down. Also, I’ve avoided telling my boss about my stress—don’t want him to think I’m unreliable, even though I’m barely keeping up.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Patient reports persistent anxiety, catastrophic thoughts about academic failure, and sleep disturbances (replaying test, insomnia). Compulsive cleaning and overworking to manage panic; feels shame around seeking help. Fear of judgment for needing counseling; links self-worth to success since childhood. Notable quote: 'I want to stop feeling like this one failure defines my whole future.'

Objective: No suicidal ideation or substance use. Observed avoidance behaviors (isolation, compulsive cleaning), exhaustion impacting work/school performance, and reliance on OTC sleep aids with limited efficacy. Family history of strict academic/work expectations; childhood financial struggles reinforced fear of failure.

Assessment: Anxiety with catastrophic thinking, maladaptive coping (compulsive behaviors, avoidance), perfectionism rooted in childhood experiences, sleep disturbance perpetuating cycle. Shame and fear of judgment impede help-seeking. Protective factors: resilience, peer support, job stability.

Plan: Prioritize cognitive strategies to challenge catastrophic thoughts, grounding techniques for nighttime anxiety, and sleep hygiene. Address shame/perfectionism through Socratic questioning and behavioral experiments. Monitor work-school balance and explore stress management. Reassess sleep aid use and consider CBT-I referral if needed.
