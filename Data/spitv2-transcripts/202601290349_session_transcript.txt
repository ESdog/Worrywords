interviewer: Hi Justin, is there a preferred pronoun I should use when referring to you?

patient: He/him is fine. I don’t have any specific preferences beyond that.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Justin. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you to seek counseling at this time?

patient: I’ve been struggling for a while with feeling like I don’t deserve the good things that happen, even when they feel objectively positive—like landing this job. The more I try to tell myself I earned it, the more I convince myself it’s just luck or a fluke. It’s starting to hurt how I show up at work and even how I interact with people. I guess I’m here because I can’t keep letting this hold me back, and I don’t know how to fix it on my own.

interviewer: It sounds like this pattern of self-doubt is really impacting your confidence and relationships, Justin. Would you like me to briefly explain how these counseling sessions typically work?

patient: Yeah, that would help. I guess I’m not really sure what to expect, but I’ve never done counseling before. I’ve just been… stuck in this cycle where I can’t stop doubting myself, even when things go well. It’s like I don’t deserve it or something. I’m willing to try, though—especially if it could help me stop letting this self-doubt ruin my work and relationships.

interviewer: It takes courage to seek help, Justin, and I appreciate your willingness to work on this. Are you comfortable continuing with our session today?

patient: Yeah, I guess so. A little nervous, honestly, but I really want to work on these thoughts that keep undermining me. It’s just hard to believe I deserve to be here, you know?

interviewer: It makes sense to feel nervous when starting something new, Justin. Do you have any immediate questions about how these sessions will work before we move forward?

patient: I don’t have any immediate questions, but I guess I’m just a bit nervous about how this will work. I’ve never done counseling before, so I’m not exactly sure what to expect. I hope we can figure out why I can’t stop discounting the good things—like the job I actually worked hard for.

system: ---

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Justin. It takes courage to seek help for these challenges. Can you tell me more about when you first started feeling this way about your job and achievements?

patient: It started almost immediately after I got the job offer. I was excited at first, but then I kept thinking, 'Why them? Why not someone else?' Like, maybe they just made a mistake or I got lucky. Even though I worked hard for it, I couldn’t shake the feeling I wasn’t actually qualified enough. It’s been like that every day since—whenever I finish a task or get praised, I downplay it in my head. It’s exhausting.

interviewer: It sounds like this constant self-doubt is taking a toll on your energy. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or how motivated you feel to do things you usually enjoy?

patient: Yeah, it’s been tough. I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night, my mind racing about whether I’m ‘worthy’ of the job or if I’ll mess something up. Lately, I’ve skipped weekend hikes with friends—I used to love those, but now I feel like I’d just be faking enjoyment or ‘wasting time’ when I should be proving myself instead.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how this has affected your sleep and social life—it sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. You mentioned trying to challenge these thoughts by reminding yourself of your skills, but it’s been hard to break the pattern. What other strategies have you tried to manage these feelings, and how effective have they been?

patient: I’ve tried writing down my achievements in a journal to 'prove' them to myself, but I end up deleting the entries or minimizing them, like thinking, 'This was just a fluke.' I also tried setting small, manageable goals to build confidence, but I still feel like I’m faking it even when I meet them. The biggest problem is I can’t internalize any of it—it’s all just noise my brain tunes out.

interviewer: It sounds like these patterns have created a lot of internal conflict, especially between your achievements and how you perceive them. To wrap up this part of our conversation, can you share what specific goals you hope to achieve through counseling? For example, is there something you’d like to change or work toward in the next few months?

patient: I guess my main goal is to learn how to stop undermining myself and truly believe I deserve the good things that happen, like this job. I want to figure out why I can’t just accept my accomplishments without brushing them off. I also hope to get better at handling work stress and stop letting self-doubt mess up how I interact with colleagues. Maybe if I can work on building my self-esteem, I’ll start seeing my achievements for what they are instead of writing them off as luck. I’m not sure exactly how counseling will help, but I’m ready to put in the work if it means not holding myself back anymore.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that; it takes courage to seek help for something that feels so deeply personal. Let’s explore a bit more about your background. Have you experienced any significant challenges or difficult experiences in the past that might be connected to how you view your achievements or self-worth?

patient: I don't remember major past challenges like trauma or abuse, but looking back, my parents always emphasized being 'the best' in academics and extracurriculars. If I got anything less than an A, they’d say, 'You’re capable of more.' It felt like no matter what I did, it wasn’t enough to earn their approval. Maybe that planted the seed for thinking success is something I have to prove, not something I can just achieve through effort.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that insight about your upbringing—it’s clear how those expectations might shape your current self-perception. Let’s explore your current context a bit more: what stressors or challenges in your new job or daily life feel most tied to these thoughts of self-doubt?

patient: The biggest stressor is when I take on projects that require independent decision-making. I spend hours over-preparing, second-guessing every choice like I'm waiting for someone to point out I'm unqualified. Even when the work gets praised, I tell myself it was just 'easy luck' or the team carried me. Recently, a presentation I led went smoothly, but I focused on one small technical error instead of the positive feedback. That kind of self-criticism makes me avoid social interactions at work afterward because I feel... fraudulent. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle where success just makes me fear exposure more.

interviewer: It sounds like your upbringing has played a significant role in shaping these patterns—thank you for sharing that vulnerability. Let’s explore further: Have you experienced any other difficult experiences or adversities in your life that might be connected to how you view your achievements or self-worth?

patient: I don’t recall specific major challenges beyond what I mentioned. My current struggles feel tied more to my job and how I perceive success rather than past events. That said, I wonder if growing up in a competitive environment might have contributed, but I’ve never really thought about it before now. I’m not sure how much that’s connected, though.

interviewer: It’s thoughtful of you to consider how your upbringing might connect to these patterns—thank you for reflecting on that. Let’s clarify one thing: Have you experienced similar patterns of self-doubt or imposter syndrome in past roles or life contexts, even if they felt less intense?

patient: Not really, at least not in a way that felt this intense. I’ve always been a bit hard on myself, but with this job, it’s like everything gets magnified. I used to think I was just ‘humble’ about my work, but now it feels more like I can’t let myself believe I’m good at anything, even when others say so.

interviewer: It’s thoughtful of you to consider how your upbringing connects to these patterns—thank you for that reflection. Let’s explore your support system: Who do you typically turn to when you’re feeling overwhelmed or stressed at work, and how do they usually respond when you share these thoughts with them?

patient: I usually try to handle it on my own first, but when I do reach out, it's mostly my sister or one close friend. They're supportive, but I end up downplaying things even more—I tell them I'm just stressed about work, not that I feel like a fraud. My sister always says I 'talk myself out of my wins,' which I hate hearing because it feels true but embarrassing. I guess I worry if I admit how I really feel, they'll think I'm ungrateful for the job I have.

interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use since starting your new job?

patient: No, I haven’t noticed any changes in my alcohol or cannabis use since starting the job. I haven’t used cannabis in years, and I only drink alcohol occasionally at social events. I don’t see it as something I need to address right now, but I’ll consider it if it becomes a concern.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that about your substance use. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts of harming myself or ending my life. But there are days when I feel trapped by this constant self-doubt, like I’m stuck in a loop of convincing myself I don’t deserve good things... it’s exhausting, but I haven’t let it go that far.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about how exhausting this self-doubt can be. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or need for sleep lately?

patient: Yeah, my sleep’s been off. I’ll lie awake at night replaying work mistakes or wondering if I’m going to get found out as a ‘fraud.’ When I do sleep, it feels shallow—I wake up tired, like I didn’t rest properly. It’s making me more irritable, and I’ve canceled plans with friends twice this week because I’m too drained to even get out of bed.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how sleep disturbances are impacting your daily life. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or restless, or have you taken on more tasks than usual despite not needing much sleep?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced unusual energy or restlessness. My sleep issues are more about difficulty winding down at night because my mind races with self-doubt. When I do get rest, it’s usually because I’m physically exhausted from overthinking work or feeling drained by the effort to appear competent.

interviewer: Thank you for explaining how your self-doubt affects your rest. Have you noticed any experiences that feel unusual, like hearing voices others don’t hear, seeing things that aren’t there, or having thoughts that feel paranoid or disconnected from reality?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced hearing voices or seeing things that aren’t there. My struggles are more around persistent self-doubt and feeling like a fraud, even when things go well. The stress I feel is about internal criticism, not paranoid thoughts or disconnect from reality.

interviewer: I’m glad to hear there’s no active suicidal ideation. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be related to your symptoms? Also, are you currently taking any medications or supplements?

patient: No, I haven’t been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues or sleep apnea. The intake form mentioned I don’t have significant physical illnesses. I’m not currently taking any medications or supplements either.

interviewer: Thank you for detailing how your self-doubt impacts your rest and interactions. To fully address the phase goals, I need to clarify one more area: Have you used any other substances like stimulants, opioids, or recreational drugs beyond alcohol and cannabis? This helps ensure we capture all factors that might influence your symptoms.

patient: No, I haven’t used any other substances. I used to consider stimulants for focus before starting this job, but I never actually tried them. It’s awkward having to list all this out—it makes me self-conscious about seeming... unreliable?

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Let me recap what we've explored: Your self-doubt and imposter syndrome began with your new job, likely fueled by perfectionist upbringing and fear of being exposed as unqualified. These thoughts disrupt your sleep, work performance, and social connections, but you're motivated to build self-compassion and challenge these patterns. What did I miss or need to adjust in this summary?

patient: You captured the core issues well. What you might have missed is the specific link to my parents’ constant pressure to overachieve academically, which taught me I could never be good enough—it’s not just perfectionism, but a fear of never earning unconditional approval. Also, my struggle to accept even basic praise from colleagues feels like I’m failing at being ‘gracious,’ which adds shame. Lastly, the part where I cancel social plans because I feel ‘unworthy’ of spending time with others, even friends, is another piece of how this affects daily life beyond work.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those important nuances—it's clear how deeply rooted these patterns are. Let me try to integrate this into a working model: Your upbringing with conditional approval may have shaped a core belief that self-worth depends on relentless achievement. This was likely reinforced (precipitated) by your new job's demands, triggering cycles of self-criticism and avoidance. The ongoing struggle to accept praise and isolate socially now perpetuates this pattern, though your self-awareness and supportive relationships are key protective factors. Does this align with your experience, or would you add/correct anything?

patient: Yes, that’s accurate—your summary captures the core of it. I’d add that the job’s high expectations amplify the fear of being ‘found out,’ which makes me hyper-focused on tiny mistakes and avoid socializing after successes, even with people who genuinely support me.

interviewer: Thank you for that clarification—it’s clear how this dynamic creates a cycle of self-doubt and isolation. To move forward, I’d like to propose a next step: We could start by developing a structured plan to challenge these automatic thoughts, perhaps using cognitive exercises and self-compassion practices tailored to your work and social contexts. Would this align with your goals, or is there something else you’d prefer to prioritize first?

patient: I think that sounds like a good plan—I’m open to trying structured exercises, especially if they’re tailored to work situations where I struggle the most. I’m worried it’ll be hard to break the habit of dismissing my achievements, though, since it’s been such a long-standing pattern. My sister always tells me I ‘talk myself out of my wins,’ which is true—I’d like to learn how to stop that.

interviewer: Thank you for your honesty—breaking long-standing patterns can feel daunting, but we’ll approach it step by step. Before we finalize our next steps, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust in our understanding of what’s been most challenging for you?

patient: I think what’s hardest is how this affects my relationships outside work too. I used to enjoy weekend hikes with friends, but now I cancel last-minute, fearing I’ll ‘mess up’ by acting ungrateful or pretentious if things go well. It’s like I’m punishing myself for even having good days.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing how this extends to your relationships—it’s understandable to feel unworthy of connection when self-doubt is so ingrained. Let me adjust our working model: The fear of being ‘found out’ now includes avoiding social interactions even with supportive friends, compounding isolation and shame. Does this revised understanding align with your experience, or would you add anything further before we finalize next steps?

patient: Yes, that aligns with how it feels. After work successes, I avoid friends because I’m hyper-aware they might notice the ‘fraud’ I think I am, but then I feel even worse when I isolate. It’s like a loop where avoiding them makes the shame stick around longer. I guess I’d also add that when I do try to connect, I’m constantly scanning for subtle signs they’re judging me—like if they laugh at something I say, I second-guess if it’s genuine or pity.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that cycle of avoidance and shame—it’s clear how isolating this pattern becomes. To finalize our next steps, what would you prefer to prioritize first: structured cognitive exercises for work/social contexts, exploring self-compassion practices, or another approach? Are there any other concerns we should address before moving forward?

patient: I think structured cognitive exercises for work and social contexts would help me most right now. The job stress feels the most immediate, and I need practical tools to stop discounting my skills when I’m in high-pressure situations. But I’d also like to explore self-compassion later—maybe after I build some confidence in challenging those automatic thoughts. I don’t want to skip the basics, though. Are there other concerns?... Maybe my sleep? The racing thoughts at night feel connected to the same self-doubt cycle.

interviewer: Thank you for highlighting the sleep connection—it’s clear how this self-doubt cycle affects multiple areas of your life. Before we finalize our plan, is there anything else we should address or adjust in our understanding of your concerns?

patient: I think the main thing is understanding how my past—like my parents' expectations—still shows up in my work habits. I over-prepare for meetings, check emails late at night even when tired, and second-guess every decision. It’s like I’m trying to 'prove' my worth constantly. Also, when colleagues praise me, I smile but mentally brush it off, which probably makes me seem distant. Maybe we should explore how to stop the 'I’ll be found out' fear that follows every success. And... I wonder if my sleep issues are partly from avoiding rest until I ‘deserve’ it, which just fuels the cycle.
