interviewer: Allison, before we begin, I just want to confirm—would you like me to use a different name or pronouns? I want to make sure I respect your preferences.

patient: No, Allison is correct and I use she/her pronouns. Thank you for checking.

interviewer: Thank you for confirming, Allison. I appreciate your openness. Allison, can you confirm that you're comfortable proceeding with our session today?

patient: Yes, I think so. It feels a bit awkward at first, but I’m ready to talk through it. The frustration’s been weighing on me, so this seems like the right step.

interviewer: I'm glad you're ready to work through this. To set the frame, our sessions will involve discussing your concerns and exploring strategies to support you. Does that align with what you're hoping for today?

patient: Yes, that sounds good. I’m hoping to figure out why this feels so frustrating and how to stop letting it ruin my enjoyment. It’s supposed to be fun, but now it just stresses me out.

interviewer: It’s clear how much this frustration has impacted your enjoyment, Allison. Do you have any questions or concerns about how we’ll proceed before we move forward?

patient: I guess I’m just not sure if talking about this will actually help me feel better. I’ve spent so much time trying to figure it out on my own, but maybe... maybe this could be a way to finally figure out how to stop feeling so stuck about it?

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like this frustration has been building over time. Can you tell me when you first noticed these feelings starting, and if there was a specific moment or change that seemed to trigger them?

patient: It all started when I first joined the league last fall. I remember the first week, I thought I had a solid team, but then I misread the scoring rules and lost points. That moment made me feel like I was fumbling from the start, and it’s just been building ever since. I try to catch up, but every week there’s another rule I missed or a strategy I didn’t consider.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the ongoing frustration has been really draining. What would you most like to achieve through our work together?

patient: I guess I want to stop letting this game consume me in such a negative way. It used to be fun, but now it just feels like a chore that I’m bad at. I want to understand why I can’t let go of it and how to enjoy the time I spend on it without it making me feel so... broken afterward.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that vulnerable reflection. It sounds like the emotional weight of these feelings is really impacting your self-perception. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, energy levels, or sleep patterns that seem connected to this frustration?

patient: Yes, I've noticed my mood feels more irritable lately, especially after league results are posted. I also sometimes stay up late ruminating about my team's performance, which leaves me more tired the next day. My energy during the day feels... inconsistent, like I'm drained after spending hours on the game but still can't shake the frustration.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I appreciate your openness in sharing how this has affected your enjoyment. To better understand patterns, have you experienced any significant stressors, challenges, or traumatic events in your life that might be connected to these feelings of frustration or self-doubt?

patient: I don’t think there’s anything else that’s really linked to this... This is actually the first time I’ve felt this kind of frustration with something I enjoy. I’ve always tried to stay positive, but this feels different. It’s like I can’t shake the sense that I’m just not ‘getting it,’ even when I’m putting in the work.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that this feels uniquely frustrating despite your usual positivity. Let's explore your support system—can you tell me more about the friends you have in the fantasy football league? How do they typically interact with you during the season?

patient: My friends in the league are mostly people I work with and a few from college. We mostly interact through the app—trading players, sending jokes about draft picks, or trash-talking after weekly results. They’re pretty laid-back, but I feel like they all know the rules instinctively, while I have to double-check everything. I’ve avoided talking to them about *my* frustration because I don’t want them to think I’m… I don’t know, weak or whiny? It’s embarrassing to admit I still don’t fully get the nuances, even after all this time.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I want to ask about your substance use history. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances like stimulants or opioids in the past year? Have you noticed any changes in your use recently?

patient: I don't use alcohol or drugs regularly. I haven't felt the need to use anything to cope with the stress from the league, but I'll admit I've had a few late nights where I maybe drank more coffee than I should have while analyzing rosters. Nothing else, though.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about the coffee. Let's talk about your well-being. Have you ever had thoughts of intentionally harming yourself or ending your life, even if only briefly?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts like that. My frustration has been intense, but it’s never reached the point of wanting to harm myself. I’ve just felt stuck in this cycle of stress and embarrassment, but I know it’s not life-threatening—just really draining.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Let's talk about your energy levels. Have you noticed any changes in your energy or sleep patterns recently—like feeling more energetic than usual or needing significantly less sleep?

patient: Yes, I've been staying up late ruminating over the league results, which leaves me exhausted and with inconsistent energy levels the next day. It's like my brain can't switch off, and even small mistakes feel huge when I'm so tired.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress from the league is really taking a toll on your rest and energy. Let’s check in on other patterns—have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic, restless, or needed very little sleep for days at a time, even when stressed? This helps me understand your overall energy regulation.

patient: No, I don’t think so. The stress has mostly left me exhausted, not energized. I do stay up late ruminating over matches, but it’s more like my brain won’t shut off than feeling hyper or restless. I’ve never experienced that ‘unusual energy’ you’re asking about—it’s all just been this draining cycle of frustration and sleeplessness for me.

interviewer: It sounds like your fatigue and frustration have been persistent without the ups and downs of hypomania. Let’s check in on another area—have you noticed any unusual thoughts or perceptions lately, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or feeling strongly that people are targeting you in some way?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced anything like hearing voices or seeing things. My thoughts have mostly been fixated on overanalyzing the game rules and second-guessing my decisions. Sometimes I feel like everyone else ‘gets it’ intuitively, and I’m just... stuck trying to catch up. It’s more self-criticism than anything surreal.

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing stress without turning to substances, which is a strength. Have you been taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins regularly—prescribed or over-the-counter—that might affect your mood or energy levels?

patient: No, I’m not taking any medications or supplements regularly. I tried a multivitamin once, but I don’t think it made a difference.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like the frustration around your fantasy football league has created a cycle of self-doubt and exhaustion, but you're also showing strength by seeking help and reflecting on what's working and not working. What did I miss?

patient: I think what might be missing is how this league feels like it’s testing my worth—like if I can’t ‘get’ it, I’m not just bad at the game but maybe unskilled in ways that matter. And while I say I want to enjoy it, part of me secretly thinks I *should* be great at it, which makes the losses feel personal. Also, I haven’t mentioned how I sometimes avoid checking the league app for days because it’s too anxiety-inducing, but then I hyperfocus later to ‘catch up’—it’s this push-pull that’s exhausting.

interviewer: It sounds like this cycle of avoidance and hyperfocus, paired with tying your self-worth to performance in the league, has created a pattern that feels both emotionally and physically draining. What did I miss?

patient: I think you might’ve missed how much I fear being judged as ‘not trying hard enough’ by others in the league. Even though I avoid talking to them, I constantly worry they notice my mistakes or see my late-night second-guessing as weakness. It feels like there’s a silent standard everyone else meets, and I’m the only one scrambling to catch up—like I’m secretly failing at being a ‘real’ participant. It’s not just about losing the game; it’s like I’m proving I’m not good enough, even in a space that was supposed to be fun.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that—the fear of being judged as 'not trying hard enough' adds another layer to how this league is impacting your self-perception and social interactions. To wrap up, let’s outline next steps. What would you like to prioritize first in addressing these patterns? For example, would you prefer to explore strategies for managing the anxiety around league interactions, or breaking the cycle of avoidance and hyperfocus? Feel free to add anything else I haven’t covered.

patient: I think breaking the cycle of hyperfocus would be a good first step—before the league even starts, I’m already overcommitting hours to perfecting teams, which leaves me drained and more prone to stress. If we could explore how to set clearer boundaries around my time and energy for this, it might ease the pressure. I also want to work on the fear of asking for help, since that’s keeping me stuck in the ‘I should already know this’ mindset. Those two things feel like they’d tackle both the exhaustion and the frustration roots.

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve identified key patterns: perfectionism around league performance, fear of judgment driving avoidance and hyperfocus cycles, and rigid self-expectations that amplify frustration. To clarify, would you say this model captures your experience, or is there something important I’ve overlooked? What did I miss?

patient: I think that captures a lot of it—especially the comparison to others in the league. I feel like they’re all ‘naturals’ while I’m constantly second-guessing, which makes me hyperfocus even more. What I’d add is how this obsession crowds out other hobbies I used to enjoy, like reading. I used to lose myself in books, but now I’m too drained from analyzing spreadsheets to focus on anything else. It’s like the game isn’t even fun anymore—it’s just this… compulsion I can’t break.

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve captured how this compulsion is crowding out your reading and other hobbies, adding to the sense of being trapped in a cycle you can’t control. What did I miss?

patient: You didn’t miss much, but maybe the part where I feel like I’m overcompensating by reading every rulebook and forum post twice—like if I just memorize everything, it’ll fix the shame. Also, I haven’t mentioned how I sometimes skip my morning walks to analyze rosters at 2 a.m., then feel guilty for letting my health slip. It’s like the guilt and the guilt about the guilt are both fueling the cycle.

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve captured how the guilt and overcompensation are fueling the cycle, along with the physical toll it’s taking on your routine. To confirm, would you say this model reflects your experience, or is there anything still missing? What did I miss?

patient: The model captures a lot, but I think the part about comparing myself to others is even deeper. My friends seem to 'get it' instantly, and I can’t shake the feeling they’re judging me for being slow to learn. It’s like I’m not just failing at the game—I’m failing at being *good* at it, which feels like a personal flaw.

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve woven in the deeper layer of self-comparison and the personalization of failure. Before finalizing our next steps, is there anything else you’d want to add to this model to ensure it fully reflects your experience? What did I miss?

patient: What’s maybe missing is how much this feels like a personal failure—not just not getting the rules, but that I can’t *adapt* like others do. It’s like everyone else sees the game as fun and fluid, but I feel like I’m decoding a foreign language every week. I keep thinking, ‘Why can’t I just *get* it?’ Even when I research, it’s like the rules shift, and I’m always playing catch-up. I guess… it’s making me question if I’m just not ‘sharp’ enough in areas that matter to people I respect. I haven’t said it out loud yet, but part of me fears this is a sign I’m… not capable in ways that matter beyond fantasy football.

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve captured how the personalization of failure and rigid self-expectations are central to this cycle, along with the toll it’s taking on your energy and hobbies. To finalize next steps, let’s clarify: Would you be comfortable starting with strategies to set boundaries around league time and practice self-compassion when learning feels challenging, while also exploring how to reframe comparisons to others? Is there anything else you’d add to this plan?

patient: Yes, that sounds like a good starting point. I think setting clearer time limits would help—I often lose track of hours spent tweaking lineups. I also struggle with nighttime rumination about 'what if' scenarios, so maybe techniques to quiet that would help. And maybe some guidance on how to broach this with my friends without feeling ashamed? I want to stop letting this drain my energy and joy.

interviewer: Thank you for adding those important details about time boundaries, nighttime rumination, and communication with friends—they’ll guide our focus moving forward. To confirm, would you say this model and next steps fully capture what’s most urgent for you, or is there one more piece we should address before finalizing? What did I miss?

patient: I think the core issues are covered, but maybe the fear of judgment from friends if I admit how overwhelmed I feel? I worry they’ll think I’m overreacting, which makes me isolate more. That’s part of why I keep ruminating alone instead of asking for help.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the fear of judgment—it’s clear this fear of being seen as 'overreacting' is deeply tied to your isolation and rumination. To finalize, would you say this model and next steps fully capture what’s most urgent for you, or is there one more piece we should address before finalizing? What did I miss?

patient: ...

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that fear of judgment—it’s clear how much this is fueling your isolation and rumination. To finalize, would you say this model and next steps fully capture what’s most urgent for you, or is there one more piece we should address before finalizing? What did I miss?

patient: I think what’s missing is how this is starting to bleed into my confidence in other areas. I catch myself doubting my decisions in other parts of life, like when I make small mistakes at work, and now I’m hyper-focused on proving I’m competent somewhere. It’s not just the league anymore—it’s making me feel unmoored.

interviewer: It sounds like the self-doubt from the league is now spilling into your work confidence, creating a sense of being unmoored in daily life. What did I miss?

patient: Actually, my work hasn't been affected—this is strictly about the league and my hobbies. I think I mentioned how it’s making me question my ability to *enjoy* things, not my job performance. I guess you might’ve wondered if there’s a bigger pattern, but this really started and stays within the fantasy football world.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Allison reports frustration and self-doubt related to fantasy football league participation since fall 2023. Symptoms include irritability, sleep disturbances (late-night rumination), emotional exhaustion, and avoidance of league interactions. She describes a cycle of hyperfocus on rules/strategies followed by avoidance due to anxiety. Emotional impact includes self-criticism ('I’m not sharp enough') and fear of judgment ('they’ll think I’m weak').

Objective: No significant medical history. No suicidal ideation or substance use beyond caffeine. Social functioning impacted by avoidance of league peers and neglect of hobbies (e.g., reading). Work performance unaffected. Observed cognitive patterns: perfectionism, fear of failure, and rumination.

Assessment: Chronic stress from performance-based self-criticism in low-stakes social context. Anxiety-driven avoidance/hyperfocus cycle. Fear of social judgment exacerbates isolation. No hypomanic symptoms. No psychotic features. Emerging self-worth tied to external validation in recreational activity.

Plan: 1) Establish time-bound league engagement strategies. 2) Cognitive restructuring for self-criticism and social comparison. 3) Sleep hygiene and rumination-breaking techniques. 4) Gradual exposure to peer communication about struggles. 5) Monitor for generalization of self-doubt to other domains.
