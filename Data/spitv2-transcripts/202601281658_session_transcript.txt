interviewer: Michelle, to start, would you like to share your preferred name or pronouns, if different from what's on your intake form?

patient: I go by Michelle, and I use she/her pronouns. That’s all on my intake form, I think.

interviewer: Michelle, today's session will focus on understanding your concerns and how we can work together. We'll start by discussing what's been on your mind lately, and then I'll ask some questions to better understand your experience. Does that sound okay to you?

patient: Yes, that sounds okay. I guess I’ve just been really struggling with these feelings of not being smart enough or good enough, especially in my graduate program. It’s hard to explain, but I keep comparing myself to others, and it’s making me doubt everything I do. I’m not used to talking about this, though.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Michelle. It takes courage to talk about these feelings. Do you have any questions about how today's session will work or anything specific you'd like to focus on?

patient: Thank you... I guess I’m not entirely sure where to start. I’d like to work on these feelings of not being good enough, especially with my studies. It’s hard to focus when I’m constantly comparing myself to others. I’m worried it’s holding me back, but I’m not sure how to fix it.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about what’s been on your mind lately that brought you to seek counseling? What specific challenges have you been facing in your graduate program that feel most overwhelming right now?

patient: Lately, I've been really overwhelmed by my coursework and research deadlines. I feel like everyone else in my program is ahead of me, publishing papers or landing internships, while I'm still struggling to finish my thesis proposal. Last week, I had to resubmit a paper after my advisor said it wasn't 'rigorous enough'—it hit me hard, like confirmation I'm not cut out for this. I've been staying up late revising, but my brain feels foggy in the mornings, and I can't focus. My roommate said I seem distant, but I don't know how to explain it without sounding... dramatic. I just keep thinking I'm one mistake away from being exposed as a fraud.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to meet academic expectations is really weighing on you, and the feedback about your paper felt like a blow to your confidence. Can you help me understand when these feelings of inadequacy first started in your graduate program and how they’ve changed over time? Were there any specific events or turning points that made things feel more overwhelming recently?

patient: The feelings started in my first semester here. At first, it was just occasional self-doubt, but they’ve gotten sharper over time. The feedback on my paper last month really hit hard—I’d worked so hard, and the criticism felt like proof I wasn’t capable. It’s like comparing myself to peers who seem to breeze through stuff made it worse. I tried to ignore it earlier, but now it’s nonstop, even when I’m doing well. It’s worse than undergrad, where I could at least fake confidence sometimes.

interviewer: It sounds like this pattern of self-criticism has been increasingly disruptive to your academic work and relationships. Can you share what you’re most hoping to address or change through counseling—what would make a meaningful difference for you right now?

patient: I want to break this cycle of comparing myself to others and believing I’m not enough. It’s making me freeze academically and push people away, and I need to learn how to trust my abilities instead of letting fear take over. I’m really tired of feeling like I have to work twice as hard just to prove I belong here.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like these thoughts have really taken a toll on your daily life and studies. To better understand your current state, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels, sleep patterns, or feelings of restlessness or impulsivity lately?

patient: I’ve been feeling more fatigued lately, especially after staying up late to revise my paper. My sleep’s been all over the place—some nights I can’t stop thinking and end up awake until 3 AM. I don’t think I’m being impulsive, but I do feel keyed up sometimes, like I can’t relax even when I want to. It’s hard to shake this constant mental pressure.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those details, Michelle. It sounds like the mental pressure and sleep disruptions are really wearing on you. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: No, I haven’t had thoughts of harming myself or ending my life. But I’ve definitely felt overwhelmed to the point where I question if I can keep going—like when I was up all night revising that paper and wondering if it’s even worth the effort. It’s more this constant mental drain than anything else.

interviewer: I appreciate you being so open about this. It sounds like the pressure you're under is really affecting your sleep and energy. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or restless, or take risks you wouldn't normally take—like working long hours without rest or making impulsive decisions?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced those kinds of episodes. When I’m stressed, I tend to overwork out of fear of failing, like staying up late to revise my paper, but it’s more from anxiety than restlessness. I worry about making impulsive choices because I already feel like I need to be cautious to avoid mistakes. It’s more like... my brain won’t shut off, but it’s exhausting, not energizing.

interviewer: Thank you for explaining that. It sounds like the mental pressure you're under is really affecting your sleep and energy. Have you noticed any unusual thoughts or perceptions, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don't, or feeling overly suspicious about people around you?

patient: No, I haven't experienced hearing voices or seeing things. But I do sometimes feel overly self-critical and question my own thoughts a lot, like I can't trust my judgment anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the self-critical thoughts and sleep challenges are really adding to your stress. To get a fuller picture, do you currently use any substances like alcohol, cannabis, or stimulants to cope with stress or help you sleep?

patient: No, I don’t use cannabis or stimulants. Maybe I’ll have a glass of wine occasionally if I’m really stressed, but I try to avoid it as much as possible. I do rely a lot on coffee to stay awake—sometimes I feel like I can’t function without it.

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing stress through coffee and occasional wine, which I appreciate you sharing. Have you been prescribed any medications or taken any supplements—prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal—for anxiety, sleep, or other concerns lately?

patient: No, I haven’t been prescribed any medications or taken supplements for anxiety or sleep. I usually rely on coffee during the day and sometimes wine in the evenings to help me unwind, but I don’t take anything else. I’ve never really thought about using supplements, though I’ve wondered if something might help with the racing thoughts at night.

interviewer: It sounds like you're navigating a lot of pressure while relying on your usual coping strategies. Are there any people, activities, or things that help you feel supported or provide a sense of stability during these challenging times?

patient: Honestly, my support system feels pretty limited right now. I have a few friends I can talk to, but I haven’t shared these specific feelings with them—I worry they might not understand. When I’m overwhelmed, I sometimes go for long walks around campus or get lost in reading fiction; it helps me mentally step away. I guess my morning routine gives me a sense of control, even though everything else feels shaky. It’s just… not enough lately.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

interviewer: Michelle, to recap, your main concerns are persistent self-doubt and academic pressure worsening over the past year, intensified by recent feedback, leading to sleep issues, mental fatigue, and strained relationships. Protective factors include your morning routine, campus walks, and cautious coping strategies like reading fiction. Is there anything I missed or misrepresented here?

patient: Yes, that’s pretty much it. I’d maybe add that the self-doubt feels automatic now—even when I’m doing well, I can’t shake the fear I’m ‘not enough.’ And the advisor’s critique really shattered my confidence, making me question if I’m qualified for this program.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that—the advisor’s feedback sounds like it really amplified your self-doubt. To frame this, it seems like long-standing tendencies toward self-criticism (predisposing) may have been triggered by the recent critique (precipitating), and now patterns like comparing yourself to peers and avoiding sharing struggles might be keeping these thoughts going (perpetuating). Meanwhile, your morning routines and campus walks are examples of protective factors. Does this model align with your experience, or is there something I’ve missed?

patient: Yes, that model feels accurate. The advisor’s feedback was especially crushing because it came from someone I respect, making the self-doubt feel 'valid' in a way comparisons to peers don’t. I think the isolation is key—by not sharing my struggles, I miss chances to realize others feel similar, which probably keeps the cycle going. My routines help, but they’re more about managing stress than addressing the root of the self-criticism.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that insight about isolation—recognizing how not sharing struggles might keep the cycle going is a meaningful step. Let’s talk about next steps: what would you like to prioritize in our work together? For example, building strategies to address self-criticism, exploring ways to connect with peers, or other goals that feel important to you?

patient: Right now, I think managing the self-criticism would be most helpful—I want to stop the habit of comparing myself to others, especially in academic settings. My advisor’s feedback on my paper really triggered that spiral, and I’d like to learn how to reframe those moments without feeling crushed. I’d also like to work on setting boundaries with my workload so I’m not burning out. My sleep issues are linked to this, so maybe building healthier habits could help both. But honestly, I’m not sure where to start, so any tools to untangle the pressure and the self-doubt would be good.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve identified some clear priorities for building self-compassion, setting boundaries, and improving sleep—thank you for sharing that openness. Before we move forward, is there anything else you’d like to add or clarify about your experience that might be important for us to consider together?

patient: I guess I also want to mention that I’ve been holding onto this fear that if I admit how overwhelmed I am, people might think I’m not cut out for this program. It’s like I’m caught between wanting help and feeling like showing vulnerability makes me ‘less’ in some way. That’s probably part of why I push myself so hard even when it’s not working—that fear of being seen as incapable.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that fear—it’s clear how this dynamic of wanting help while fearing judgment adds to your stress. To recap, our tentative model includes long-standing self-criticism, recent advisor feedback as a trigger, and isolation as a cycle-perpetuating factor, alongside protective routines. Your fear of being seen as 'incapable' if vulnerable feels central to this. Is there anything I’ve missed or misrepresented in this summary?

patient: Your summary captures the main points well—I especially agree about the advisor’s feedback being a trigger and the isolation making things worse. One thing you didn’t mention is how I feel like I need to work *twice* as hard just to be seen as capable, which adds to the burnout. Also, the overworking isn’t from restlessness, it’s straight anxiety—it’s exhausting. Otherwise, you got the cycle right.

interviewer: Thank you for highlighting the need to work twice as hard and the anxiety-driven overworking—these are important additions to our model. To ensure we’re aligned, is there anything else you’d like to add about how these factors interact or any other concerns that might be relevant to our work together?

patient: I think that covers most of it, but maybe the part about fearing judgment if I do open up to others? Like, even when I want to talk about it, I worry people will think I’m ‘not trying hard enough’ or that my struggles aren’t valid. It’s like… there’s this pressure to seem ‘together,’ even when I’m falling apart. Oh, and the advisor comment really hit hard—I’ve been replaying it a lot, wondering if I’m just not cut out for this. Even small wins feel hollow now.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about the pressure to seem 'together' and the advisor's feedback lingering in your mind. To ensure we’re aligned, is there anything else you’d like to add before we identify concrete next steps—such as specific areas you’d prefer to address first, like strategies for self-compassion, communication tools, or workload management?

patient: I think addressing how to process my advisor’s feedback without it crushing my confidence is important. I also want to work on breaking the cycle of comparing myself to peers and learning to trust my own abilities. Maybe we could start with strategies for self-compassion and practical ways to stop overanalyzing my work. And… I’d like to explore why I isolate myself instead of reaching out for support when this gets overwhelming.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve pinpointed several meaningful priorities—self-compassion, reframing feedback, and addressing isolation. Let’s build on that: would you prefer to start with a specific strategy (e.g., journaling exercises, role-playing difficult conversations, or mindfulness techniques) to untangle the advisor’s feedback and self-criticism, or another approach that feels more aligned with your needs? What did I miss?

patient: I think journaling might help me untangle the advisor’s feedback and my self-criticism—writing could help me see where the feedback is valid vs. where my thoughts spiral. I also think role-playing conversations where I ask peers or my advisor for specific guidance might ease the isolation, since I struggle to verbalize my doubts. Did I miss the part where you mentioned mindfulness? That sounds useful too, but maybe start with the journaling and role-playing first. Honestly, I’m not sure what I’m missing—I’m still learning what I need.

interviewer: Thank you for outlining those strategies—journaling and role-playing could be powerful tools to untangle self-criticism and build confidence. To ensure we’re aligned, let me summarize: We’ve identified a model where long-standing self-doubt, recent advisor feedback, and isolation are central to your struggles, with protective factors like routines and campus walks. Next steps include starting journaling to separate feedback from self-criticism, role-playing to practice seeking support, and mindfulness as a secondary step. Is this accurate, or is there anything we’ve missed that you’d like to adjust before we begin?

patient: Yes, that’s pretty much on track with what I’m feeling. The advisor feedback definitely hit hard, and the isolation thing… I’ve been avoiding group study sessions even when I’m stuck, so practicing how to ask for help even just once might help. The journaling part makes sense—I’ve tried writing before but maybe focusing on separating ‘feedback’ vs ‘me’ will make it less personal. The only thing I’m not sure about is the mindfulness step—if that’s optional at first, that’s okay. I’ll try the journaling and role-playing first, though.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Michelle reports persistent self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy in her graduate program, exacerbated by recent advisor feedback on her thesis proposal. Symptoms began in her first semester, with worsening self-criticism, academic comparison to peers, and sleep disruption (insomnia, 3 AM wakefulness). She describes mental fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and fear of being exposed as a 'fraud.' Isolation and avoidance of sharing struggles with peers contribute to cycle. No suicidal ideation, but acknowledges questioning if challenges are 'worth the effort.'

Objective: Reports sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive fog impacting academic performance. Avoidant behaviors (e.g., skipping group study). Uses coffee for alertness and occasional wine for stress relief. Morning routines and campus walks noted as partial coping mechanisms.

Assessment: Chronic self-criticism and academic perfectionism likely exacerbated by recent advisor feedback (precipitating factor). Fear of vulnerability and perceived need to work 'twice as hard' perpetuate isolation and burnout. Sleep disruption and cognitive impairment suggest stress-related functional decline. No acute safety concerns.

Plan: Prioritize journaling to differentiate feedback from self-criticism; role-play seeking academic support to reduce isolation. Explore mindfulness as secondary step. Address sleep hygiene. Monitor for worsening anxiety or depressive symptoms. Normalize academic vulnerability to challenge 'fraud' fears.
