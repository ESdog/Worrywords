 --Patient ID 1663--

interviewer: Good morning, Ms. Summers. My name is Dr. Robert Carroll. To start, would you prefer I use your full name or a different pronoun set? This will help me make you comfortable during our conversation.

patient: Good morning, Dr. Carroll. Judith Summers is fine. I don’t mind using my full name, and pronouns are the usual—she/her. Just keep it simple, if you don’t mind.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Judith. I want to make sure you're comfortable proceeding. This session will involve discussing your concerns and how we can work together. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yes, I'm okay with that. Just... hoping we can figure out how to stop these overwhelming thoughts when things are slow at work. It's starting to wear on me.

interviewer: It sounds like these thoughts are really wearing on you. Do you have any questions about how our sessions will work or what to expect?

patient: I don’t have specific questions, but I guess I’m just hoping these sessions can help me make sense of why I feel this way. I want to learn how to stop doubting myself so much when there’s no one at work, and maybe figure out why I isolate instead of talking to my friends about it. It’s just… hard to explain the anxiety without sounding like I’m making a big deal out of nothing.

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings have been really challenging to manage on your own, especially when they start affecting your confidence and relationships. What are you hoping therapy can help you with in the next few weeks or months?

patient: I hope therapy can help me understand why I feel so defeated when work slows down, even though I know it's not my fault. I want to learn how to stop the cycle of overworking and blaming myself when there's nothing to do. Maybe I can learn to talk to my friends about this instead of pushing them away when I'm struggling the most.

interviewer: It makes sense that understanding these patterns and building healthier coping strategies would be key goals. Can you tell me a bit more about when these feelings started to really impact your daily life, and what might have prompted you to seek help now?

patient: It's been about six months since I started at the cafe, and at first I thought it was just adjusting to a new job. But over time, the anxiety when things were slow... it started to eat at me. I'd lie awake at night replaying conversations or worrying about something silly like a customer's tone. My sleep got worse, and I noticed I was skipping meals because I didn't feel hungry. That's when I realized it wasn't just work stress—it was affecting everything. I'm not great at asking for help, but I knew I couldn't keep letting this drain me.

interviewer: Have you ever had thoughts of self-harm or suicide, even if they felt distant or hypothetical? I want to make sure we address any risks while we build a plan together.

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts like that... The stress has been hard, but I haven't gone that far. It’s more the constant self-criticism that’s wearing me down.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Judith. It sounds like the self-criticism is really taking a toll. Let’s shift focus slightly—have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic, restless, or irritable, even if you’re not getting much sleep?

patient: No, not really. I don’t feel unusually energetic—I usually feel more drained than anything. But when I’m stressed about work, I do get more irritable, like snapping at friends if they ask too many questions. Though I don’t think it’s from not sleeping; I just worry too much to relax even when I’m exhausted.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that, Judith. It sounds like stress significantly affects your mood and interactions. Let’s continue—have you noticed any unusual perceptions, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or holding beliefs that feel strange or hard to explain, even briefly?

patient: No, I haven't experienced anything like that. My main struggles are with anxiety and self-doubt, especially when work is slow. I haven’t noticed any strange perceptions or beliefs—it all feels pretty grounded in my worries about failing at my job, honestly.

interviewer: Thank you for being so open, Judith. It sounds like your stress has been quite persistent. Let’s move to another important area—have you been using any alcohol, cannabis, or other substances recently, even occasionally, to cope with these feelings or stress?

patient: No, I haven't used alcohol or cannabis, and I don’t use any other substances. I’ve just been trying to cope by working harder and being extra accommodating at work, but it doesn’t really help. It feels like no matter what I do, the self-doubt stays.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins on a regular basis, or have you started or stopped any recently?

patient: I’m not taking any medications or supplements right now. I’ve never been on anything for anxiety or mental health before.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing so openly, Judith. I want to make sure we cover all bases—have you experienced any medical issues like thyroid problems, chronic pain, or sleep apnea that might be contributing to your stress or anxiety?

patient: No, I don’t have any of those medical issues. My sleep problems... I think they’re tied to the anxiety and overthinking, not something physical.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Judith, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety and self-doubt began six months ago when starting your new job, worsen during slow work periods, and lead to self-criticism, overworking, and isolation. We’ve explored how fear of failure and perfectionism may be contributing, along with how this impacts your sleep, relationships, and self-esteem. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You captured most of it accurately, but maybe missed that these feelings are *completely new* for me—I’ve never struggled like this before. Also, my ‘overworking’ (like being overly accommodating to customers) hasn’t helped, and I’ve noticed my eating habits slipping too, not just sleep. Oh, and I think my isolation stems partly from *not wanting to burden friends* with these feelings—it’s hard to explain without sounding like I’m overreacting.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying those important details, Judith. Based on our discussion, here’s a tentative model: Your current struggles seem to stem from a combination of new stressors (starting this job six months ago and the fear of failure) interacting with your tendency to overwork and self-criticize, which unfortunately worsens your anxiety and isolation. Protective factors include your insight into these patterns and willingness to seek help. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: That captures the main points well, thank you. I’d add that the overanalyzing and self-blame specifically make it hard to focus during busy shifts—I’ll second-guess past interactions even when they went fine. My friends do check in, but they don’t fully understand why these slow times hit me so hard. Also, the sleep/eating disruptions are worse when I’m stuck in these cycles of self-criticism. I don’t mean to pile on, but those details might matter for understanding the full picture.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that Judith. It sounds like these cycles of self-criticism are creating significant distress during both work and personal time. Would you be open to discussing specific therapeutic strategies to address these patterns—such as cognitive-behavioral techniques to challenge self-critical thoughts or skills to manage anxiety during slow work periods? Are there other priorities or concerns we should address as we plan next steps?

patient: I’m willing to try therapy strategies if they might help—working harder hasn’t worked, so maybe learning new ways to think about these feelings could. The self-criticism feels... automatic, like I can’t stop it even when there’s no real reason. I’m not sure how talking about it would change that, though. The anxiety during slow shifts still knots my stomach, and I end up checking the registers obsessively, hoping to "prove" I’m doing something right. Would these techniques help me feel less... trapped in that loop?

interviewer: It’s understandable to feel uncertain about how these techniques might shift automatic thoughts—it’s a common challenge. Would you be open to starting with a specific strategy, such as identifying and challenging self-critical thoughts during slow shifts, to test whether this helps break the cycle? If this feels too overwhelming, we can adjust the approach.

patient: I’d be willing to try it, but it’s hard to catch those thoughts in the moment before they spiral. When the cafe is quiet, my mind just… zooms in on every little thing, like if a customer seemed even slightly unimpressed. I usually realize too late that I’m overreacting, but by then the guilt’s already set in. Maybe writing it down afterward could help?

interviewer: It sounds like writing down thoughts afterward could be a practical first step to help break the cycle. Would that be something you’d like to try as part of our next steps, and is there anything else I haven’t considered that might be important to address?

patient: Writing things down sounds like it could help—maybe seeing my thoughts on paper would make them feel less overwhelming. I’ve tried working harder to cope before, but it just made me more exhausted. If we could also talk about how to stop blaming myself for things I can’t control, that’d be important. And maybe… maybe learning to reach out to friends instead of pushing them away when I’m struggling? I think that part is hardest for me.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those priorities, Judith. To clarify next steps: we could start with structured journaling to track thoughts during slow shifts, explore cognitive techniques to challenge self-blame, and practice setting small boundaries to engage friends during distress. Does that align with what you’d like to focus on, and is there anything else we should include?

patient: Yes, that sounds helpful—especially the journaling and learning to question my self-blame. I’d also like to work on why I fear failure so much, since that drives my need to overcompensate at work. And maybe explore how to reach out to friends without feeling like a burden? I know I isolate, but it’s hard to break that pattern.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those priorities, Judith. To clarify next steps: we could start with structured journaling to track thoughts during slow shifts, explore cognitive techniques to challenge self-blame, and practice setting small boundaries to engage friends during distress. Does that align with what you’d like to focus on, and is there anything else we should include?

patient: Yes, that sounds good. The journaling could help me see when my self-blame is unreasonable, and learning to challenge those thoughts would help me at work. Talking to friends more instead of isolating is something I need to try—I just don’t know how to start. Maybe we could also look at why I feel like failure is such a big threat? It’s like that fear is tied to everything.

interviewer: It’s helpful to hear you’re open to these strategies and willing to explore the roots of your fear of failure. Before we finalize our next steps, is there anything else we haven’t discussed that feels important to include in our plan?

patient: I think... maybe the part I’m most afraid to talk about is that when I do try to open up to friends, I worry I’ll sound 'too dramatic' or like I’m complaining, which makes me shut down. It’s a cycle—I isolate, feel worse, but then can’t see how to break it without seeming 'weak'... but I’m not sure that’s relevant.
