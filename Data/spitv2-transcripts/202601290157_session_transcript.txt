interviewer: Good morning, Tracy. To start, may I use your name as Tracy, and do you have any pronoun preferences I should know about?

patient: Yes, Tracy is fine. My pronouns are she and her. Thank you for asking.

interviewer: Tracy, today we'll start by discussing what's been troubling you and how I can assist. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yes, that sounds good. I’ve been struggling with a pattern where I focus only on the negative in situations, which has made social interactions really hard for me lately. It’s like no matter how good something is, one small thing goes wrong and I fixate on that.

interviewer: It sounds like this pattern has been quite challenging, especially in social settings. Before we move forward, do you have any questions about how this process works or what to expect today?

patient: No questions right now. Thanks for asking. I guess I’m just hoping this will help me stop seeing everything as a failure when one thing goes wrong.

interviewer: It’s completely valid to hope for a shift in perspective—many find clarity through this process. Is it okay if we proceed with exploring these patterns today?

patient: Yes, I think that would help. I’ve been struggling with it so much lately—it’s like even when things go okay, I can’t shake the feeling that something went wrong. I’ve tried writing down good things, but it’s hard to focus on them when my mind keeps circling back to the negatives.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like this pattern has been really challenging, especially in social settings. Can you tell me more about what’s been different in the past few months that made this pattern become more prominent now?

patient: I think it’s been the stress of starting a new teaching job. I set really high standards for myself, and when I don’t meet them, I can’t stop thinking about how I failed, which makes me withdraw socially. Also, my best friend moved out of state, and trying to adjust to smaller social circles has made every interaction feel more… magnified.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that context. It sounds like the stress of your new job and friend moving away has amplified these patterns. Could you share how these negative thought patterns have specifically affected your teaching job or daily responsibilities lately? For example, have you noticed any changes in your ability to prepare lessons, interact with students, or manage your schedule?

patient: Yes, it’s been really tough. Even when I prepare a lesson, if one part doesn’t go perfectly—like if a student interrupts or I skip a slide—I start thinking the whole thing was useless. I’ll replay that moment in my head for hours, feeling like I’m failing. Sometimes it makes me procrastinate on planning because I’m so scared something will go wrong, and then I rush last-minute and feel worse. It’s like I can’t trust myself to do anything right, even when the kids seem okay or give good feedback. I try to write down positive moments, but it’s like my brain just won’t let me hold onto them.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the pressure to meet high standards and changes in your social circle are really weighing on you. What would you most like to achieve through therapy right now?

patient: I guess my main goal is to learn how to see things more balanced. I want to stop letting one small negative ruin everything for me. If I could actually enjoy social events without obsessing over mistakes, that would help me feel less isolated and maybe improve my relationships too.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness so far. Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant adversities in your life that might be related to these thought patterns?

patient: I don't recall any specific traumatic events, but my teenage years were really stressful—I felt constant pressure to meet high expectations from family and school. I think that's where this all-or-nothing thinking started, though it's hard to pinpoint exactly. Recently, my teaching job and my best friend moving away have made it worse, but I'm not sure if there's one 'big' thing behind it.

interviewer: It sounds like your close friendships are an important part of your life. Can you tell me about the people you feel most supported by, and how they typically help you during challenging times?

patient: My closest friends are Sarah and Linda—they’ve been really supportive. Sarah’s great at listening without judging, and she’ll just let me vent without trying to fix things. Linda’s more proactive; she’ll remind me to take breaks or help me brainstorm solutions when I’m stuck. But lately, since my best friend moved away, I’ve felt more isolated. I guess I don’t let them in on *all* the negative thoughts, though, because I don’t want to burden them. They try to cheer me up, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that I’m letting them down or that their efforts aren’t enough.

interviewer: It sounds like the move of your best friend has added to your sense of isolation, and it’s understandable to feel hesitant about burdening others with difficult thoughts. Have you experienced similar patterns of negative thinking in the past, perhaps during your teenage years when you mentioned feeling stressed? If so, what strategies, if any, helped you manage them at the time?

patient: Yes, during my teenage years I’d get stuck on negatives too, especially when school or social stuff felt overwhelming. I remember trying to distract myself by focusing on hobbies like painting or listening to music—it helped a little in the moment, but the negative thoughts always came back. I didn’t really know how to challenge them back then, so I just… let them linger. It’s weird how similar it feels now, but worse, like the negatives are louder and harder to shake.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness so far. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns lately, such as needing less sleep or feeling more energetic than usual, even when you're not getting much rest?

patient: No, I haven't noticed needing less sleep or feeling overly energetic. I do have trouble falling asleep sometimes when my mind is racing with negative thoughts, but when I do sleep, it's usually a normal amount. The stress from work and my friend moving has made it harder to unwind, though.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life, either recently or in the past?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts of harming myself or ending my life. I’ve focused on seeking help through counseling and adjusting my mindset, but those specific thoughts haven’t come up for me.

interviewer: I appreciate your clarity on this. It’s important we identify what supports help you cope during difficult times. What are some things that help you feel more stable or grounded when you're feeling overwhelmed?

patient: When I'm overwhelmed, I find that taking long walks in nature helps me feel calmer, even if just for a little while. Painting also grounds me—it forces me to focus on something creative instead of spiraling. My friends Sarah and Linda are good at pulling me out of my head, even if I don’t always open up fully about how I’m feeling.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing those coping strategies. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep for several days, even when you weren’t particularly stressed or excited about something?

patient: No, I don’t think so. I’ve mostly dealt with stress and anxiety, which actually make it harder to sleep sometimes. I can’t recall a time when I felt unusually energetic without a clear reason, like being excited about something.

interviewer: I appreciate your thoroughness in sharing so far. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances in the past few months, and if so, how has that affected your mood or functioning?

patient: No, I haven’t used any substances in the past few months. I’ve been trying to manage stress through journaling and leaning on friends, though I haven’t talked to them about this specific struggle. I guess I worry it might make things feel heavier for them.

interviewer: I appreciate your efforts to manage stress through journaling and leaning on your support network. Have you ever experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts where things seem suspicious or distorted, even when others don’t notice the same things?

patient: No, I haven't experienced hallucinations or delusions. My negative thoughts feel real to me, but I don't hear or see things others don't. I do sometimes feel overly self-critical in social settings, like people are judging me more harshly than they are, but that's more the black-and-white thinking than true paranoia.

interviewer: I appreciate your detailed responses. To ensure we cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins, either prescribed or over-the-counter?

patient: I'm not currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins. I don't have any prescriptions, and I haven't been using any over-the-counter remedies for this issue either.

interviewer: I appreciate your thoroughness. To ensure we have a complete picture, are there any medical conditions or issues—such as thyroid problems, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or past head injuries—that might be affecting your mental health or daily functioning?

patient: I don't have any medical conditions like thyroid issues or chronic pain that I'm aware of. I do have some stress-related insomnia lately—my mind races at night, which probably makes the negative thoughts worse. No head injuries or sleep apnea, though.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I want to make sure I’ve understood your experience clearly. It sounds like your all-or-nothing thinking started in your teens and has worsened recently due to work stress and a friend moving away. This pattern leads to rumination, social withdrawal, and difficulty enjoying positive moments despite trying strategies like journaling. You’re motivated to address this and improve your relationships and work performance. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: That’s mostly right, but there are a few nuances. The friend moving away made my social circle feel smaller, so even small interactions feel more intense and magnified—like every conversation carries more weight. Also, while I haven’t had conflicts in relationships, I’ve been quick to assume others are disappointed in me, which creates distance even when they’re not. And the journaling helps a *little*, but the negative thoughts still feel louder and stick around longer than the positives. I guess you didn’t miss much, though.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those nuances—it’s clear how these patterns add weight to your interactions and make positive thoughts harder to hold onto. Let me try to frame this in a way that connects the pieces: It sounds like longstanding perfectionism and a tendency to fixate on negatives (starting in your teens) were *predisposing* factors. Recent stressors like your friend moving and work demands acted as *precipitating* triggers. Now, the cycle continues because you’re avoiding sharing your struggles (to not burden others) and ruminating on perceived failures, which *perpetuates* the distress. But you also have strong *protective* factors—like your supportive friends, creative coping strategies, and motivation to change. How does that align with your experience? What did I miss or oversimplify here?

patient: You got the main points right—perfectionism from my teens definitely sets the stage, and the recent stressors have amplified it. What you might’ve oversimplified is how my academic performance stayed steady despite this, which maybe shows some resilience. Also, the impact on relationships isn’t just about misunderstandings but also me overanalyzing minor slights (like thinking a friend’s casual comment was a rejection). I’m glad you highlighted the protective factors—I do lean on Sarah and Linda a lot, even if I’m not fully open. But sometimes I feel like my negative thinking outpaces those coping strategies, even when I try to journal or paint my way through it.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying those important nuances—I appreciate your honesty about how your resilience in academics and the subtle ways overanalysis affects relationships. To wrap up, let’s shape a plan together. What would you like to prioritize first in addressing these patterns? Are there specific strategies, support systems, or areas of life you’d prefer to focus on moving forward?

patient: I think the biggest priority for me right now is learning to manage my social interactions without letting small negative moments define everything. I’d like to focus on strategies to challenge my all-or-nothing thinking in real time—maybe like practicing noticing positives as they happen, instead of waiting until later to journal. My job and my friend moving away have made social situations feel more stressful, so building confidence there would help me feel less isolated. Also, I’d like to work on setting more realistic expectations for myself, especially at work, so I don’t obsess over minor mistakes in my lessons. My friends Sarah and Linda are supportive, but I worry I push them away by holding back, so maybe learning to open up more without feeling like a burden would help too.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing your clear priorities. To summarize: We’ll start by practicing real-time strategies to challenge all-or-nothing thinking in social situations (like noticing positives as they happen), address work-related perfectionism through realistic goal-setting, and explore ways to open up to Sarah and Linda without feeling like a burden. What did I miss or need to adjust here? Are there other areas you’d like to add to this plan?

patient: You covered the main points—social situations, work perfectionism, and opening up to friends. Maybe also processing the root of the all-or-nothing thinking? The teenage stress patterns feel like they loop back to high expectations, so understanding *why* those expectations matter might help me reframe them. Also, maybe tools for quieting the nighttime racing thoughts about small mistakes—that keeps me stuck in the cycle. Other than that, the plan feels solid. I’m hopeful it’ll help me feel less like a burden to others and more in control of my thoughts.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Reports persistent all-or-nothing thinking since adolescence, worsening with recent stressors (new teaching job, friend moving out of state). Fixation on minor negatives in social/work contexts leads to rumination, social withdrawal, and self-criticism. Notes insomnia due to racing thoughts about perceived failures; journaling and creative outlets (e.g., painting) provide partial relief but negative thoughts dominate.

Objective: High-functioning academically/work-wise despite perfectionism; current job performance strained by procrastination and self-doubt. Social functioning impaired by magnified interactions and fear of burdening others. No suicidal ideation, hallucinations, or substance use. Leverages supportive friendships (Sarah, Linda) and nature/creative coping strategies.

Assessment: Predisposing factors: lifelong perfectionism and stress from high-expectation upbringing. Precipitating triggers: new job stress and social isolation post-friend move. Perpetuating factors: rumination, avoidance of sharing struggles, and overanalysis of minor social cues. Protective factors: resilient academic history, supportive social network, and adaptive coping mechanisms.

Plan: Prioritize real-time cognitive strategies to challenge all-or-nothing thinking in social/work settings; explore root causes of perfectionism. Develop tools to manage nighttime rumination. Gradually increase openness with Sarah/Linda to reduce perceived burden. Address work-related goal-setting to mitigate procrastination cycles.
