interviewer: Hello Jocelyn, thank you for coming in today. To start, may I use your name as provided, and do you have any pronoun preferences I should know about?

patient: Yes, that’s fine. Please just call me Jocelyn. I don’t have any pronoun preferences.

interviewer: Jocelyn, today's session will focus on understanding your concerns and exploring ways to support you. How does that sound?

patient: That sounds okay... I guess. I mean, I really need to figure this out, but it’s a bit scary to talk about it. I’ve just been stuck in my head for so long about getting lost forever, you know? Like, even planning a simple hike feels like a risk now.

interviewer: It makes sense to feel cautious when facing fears that feel so deeply ingrained. Are you comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: Yes, I’m ready to talk. I’m really scared about my fears, but I want to figure this out so I can start pursuing my dreams. It’s hard to explain... I just keep thinking about getting lost forever, even when I’m not even out of my room.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Jocelyn. It takes courage to address fears that feel so deeply rooted. Do you have any questions about what we’ll be discussing today or how the session will work?

patient: I guess I just want to know... how exactly will talking to you help me overcome this fear? And will we be working on specific strategies to... you know, face the uncertainty without getting paralyzed by it?

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I hear how overwhelming this fear must feel, especially when it's tied to something as important as your dreams. Can you tell me what’s been different lately that might have made these fears feel more intense?

patient: Yeah, lately at work, there was this project that required me to... I don’t know, take a bit of a risk with some decisions. It felt like a small 'exploration' task, but my anxiety spiked so bad I messed up the deliverables. My manager gave me a warning, and now I’m hyper-focused on avoiding *any* risk at work, which makes my days feel stifling. Plus, my coworkers think I’m just being lazy, but I can’t explain that I’m frozen by the fear of... of stepping into something irreversible.

interviewer: It sounds like this fear has been building for some time, and recent events at work have made it harder to ignore. Can you tell me when this fear of getting lost first started for you and how it has changed over time?

patient: I think it started when I was younger, like around 10 or 11. My family went on a camping trip, and I got separated from them briefly in the woods. It wasn’t even that far, but I panicked so bad. Since then, being in unfamiliar places feels... dangerous. Over time, it got worse. Now, even planning a simple hike makes me freeze up. The ‘lost forever’ fear feels bigger than it used to—like it’s not just about getting lost physically, but like my whole identity could disappear if I leave my comfort zone.

interviewer: It’s brave of you to share how this fear has shaped so many parts of your life. When these anxious thoughts about getting lost come up, do you notice any physical sensations—like a racing heart, tightness in your chest, or trouble breathing—that tend to happen along with them?

patient: Yeah, sometimes my heart feels like it’s racing, and my hands get all shaky. Like, even thinking about planning a trip makes me feel breathless, like I can’t take a full breath. It’s weird because I didn’t realize how much my body reacts until I started avoiding things entirely.

interviewer: It makes sense that avoiding risks feels safer in the moment, even if it limits your freedom. Looking ahead, what would you most want to be able to do differently in your life if we could work on these fears together? For example, what does ‘success’ look like for you in this process?

patient: I guess... I want to stop letting the fear of getting lost decide everything for me. Like, I want to actually plan something—maybe even a small adventure—and follow through without my mind spiraling into 'what if I never come back?' Success would be feeling like I can face uncertainty without it paralyzing me. Even taking a hike with friends without checking my phone every 10 seconds to make sure I’m still on the trail... that feels impossible right now, but it’s the kind of thing that’s starting to eat away at my confidence.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Jocelyn, you mentioned you don't have a strong support system. Is there anyone, even if it's just one person, that you feel you can rely on or talk to when things get overwhelming?

patient: Not really... there’s my cousin, but we don’t talk much, and I don’t think she’d get this kind of stuff. I guess I just keep everything inside. It’s easier than explaining how my head feels like it’s stuck on loop about getting lost, you know?

interviewer: I want to better understand what happened during that camping trip when you were 10. Would you feel comfortable sharing a bit about that experience and if anything else challenging happened around that time?

patient: The camping trip was my first real taste of panic. I wandered off to explore a trail, just curious, but got turned around in the woods. I couldn’t find my family, and my chest started pounding like a drum. I thought I’d never find my way back. My mom finally found me an hour later, but even then, I kept replaying it in my head. That night, I barely slept, imagining being lost forever. Around that time, I also stopped wanting to go on family road trips—I’d get anxious about getting off the main roads. No other big challenges happened, but that moment… it’s like a seed that kept growing. Now, even planning a simple hike feels like standing at the edge of a canyon.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I want to make sure we cover everything important. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances in the past year, even occasionally?

patient: No, I haven’t used any alcohol, cannabis, or other substances in the past year. I’ve been offered some things by friends before, but I always say no—I don’t like taking chances with anything that feels risky or out of my control.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty, Jocelyn. It takes courage to share these things. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life, even if just in passing?

patient: No, I haven’t had thoughts like that... but sometimes the fear feels so heavy, like I’m stuck in a loop where the world keeps pulling me toward the edge of a cliff. I guess I’ve worried the anxiety might swallow me whole, but I don’t know how to explain it. It’s more like… I’m terrified of disappearing into the unknown, not of disappearing on purpose.

interviewer: It sounds like this fear of disappearing into the unknown is really weighing on you. Can you tell me if there are times when you feel unusually energized or take more risks than usual, even if it’s not related to exploration?

patient: I don’t take many risks outside of my exploration dreams these days. I’ve been so afraid of uncertainty that even small changes at work make me panic. Before the project that went wrong, I used to try new tasks occasionally, but now I freeze up. My heart races, and I can’t focus—it feels like the fear is everywhere.

interviewer: It sounds like uncertainty triggers intense physical reactions for you—your body responds as if you’re in danger, even when you’re not. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed very little sleep, or had racing thoughts that were hard to control, even for short stretches?

patient: No, I haven’t really experienced those kinds of energy bursts or racing thoughts like that. My mind usually feels more like it’s stuck in a loop—like worrying about getting lost or what could go wrong. When I’m anxious, my thoughts spiral, but it’s more exhausting than energizing. Even when I try to force myself to act brave, I feel drained quickly, not hyped up.

interviewer: It sounds like your mind often feels trapped in cycles of worry rather than racing with energy. Have you ever experienced any hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that others don’t, or had thoughts that things around you are being controlled or monitored in some way?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced hallucinations or thoughts about things being controlled. My fear feels real in the sense that I get lost in my own thoughts about disappearing or losing control, but I don’t hear voices or see things others wouldn’t. It’s more like my mind traps me in a loop of ‘what ifs’ until I can’t breathe properly.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Jocelyn. It takes courage to describe such intense experiences. Could you tell me if you’re currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins—prescribed or over-the-counter?

patient: I don’t take any prescribed medications, but I sometimes use over-the-counter antacids when my stomach gets really upset from anxiety. I also started taking a B-complex vitamin on my own a few months ago—it helps me feel slightly calmer, maybe? I’m not sure if it actually works, but it’s something I do.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing about the B-complex and antacids—I’ll note those in your records. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain, that might be relevant to our discussion today?

patient: No, I don’t have any chronic medical conditions. I sometimes get stomach issues, but they’re not constant—mostly when I’m really stressed.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like your fear of getting lost is deeply tied to a past trauma and has significantly shaped your daily life and goals. What did I miss?

patient: I think you missed how my fear affects my sense of identity. I’m not just scared of getting lost—I’m scared of becoming someone who isn’t me anymore if I step into the unknown. Like, what if I try exploring and lose the part of me that’s cautious and safe? That feels worse than staying stuck. Also, maybe you didn’t catch how my mom’s reaction that day in the woods… she was so relieved but also frustrated. She kept saying, ‘You can’t just wander off,’ which I’ve replayed as if I’m the problem, not the fear. It’s like I carry that judgment of myself now.

interviewer: It sounds like your fear of the unknown isn’t just about physical safety, but also about protecting the part of yourself that feels cautious and stable—even if that caution now keeps you stuck. Your mother’s mixed reaction that day might have added to the internal pressure you feel, making it harder to separate your fear from self-judgment. What did I miss?

patient: You’re right about the cautious part of me—I feel like if I let go of that, I’ll vanish into nothing. But what you might’ve missed is how my fear isn’t just about getting lost *out there*… it’s about losing the *me* who survives by being careful. Every time I try to take a risk, I hear my mom’s sigh when she found me that day—like she saw a part of me die in those woods too. Now, I’m terrified I’ll make her relive it. And when I do something small, like a hike without checking my phone… my body acts like I’m *already* lost. It’s like fighting two fears at once: disappearing and being the person who lets themselves disappear.

interviewer: It sounds like your fear is a complex mix of protecting your identity and honoring your mother’s experience, even as it holds you back. Let me recap: Your fear of getting lost stems from a childhood trauma, is fueled by self-judgment tied to your mom’s mixed reaction, and manifests physically when you take risks. This has created a cycle where caution feels safer than growth, but it’s now blocking your dreams. What did I miss?

patient: You didn’t mention how my mom’s mixed reaction still haunts me—she never fully addressed my trauma from that camping trip. Also, I avoid main roads *and* highways now, even for short trips, which makes planning anything feel like a maze. And... the stomach pain isn’t just stress—it flares up when I even *think* about uncertainty, like when my manager assigns a project. I want to fix that cycle, but it’s like being stuck in quicksand.

interviewer: I hear how your mother’s unresolved response to your trauma and your physical reactions to uncertainty add important layers to our understanding. What did I miss?

patient: You haven’t asked about the specific moments when I try to push past the fear—like planning a small hike and then spiraling into 'what-ifs' until I cancel. Also, my mom’s reaction that day… she just kept saying, 'You’ll be safe here,' but it felt like she didn’t *see* my panic. I think that’s stuck with me. And… the physical symptoms aren’t just from thinking about getting lost—they happen when I feel like I can’t control where I’m going, even just… like choosing a new route to school.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those important details about your specific struggles with planning, your mother’s response, and how your body reacts to even minor uncertainty. To recap: Your fear is rooted in a childhood trauma, amplified by your mother’s unresolved reaction, and manifests through physical symptoms when you feel a loss of control—whether planning a hike or choosing a new route to school. What did I miss?

patient: You didn’t mention how my fear makes me pull away from people—like I’ve stopped joining friends for weekend trips because even suggesting a hike feels too risky. Also, my job issues: avoiding risks at work got me in trouble, but I can’t explain it to coworkers without sounding ‘weird.’ And… the antacids and vitamins? I take them every day, hoping it’ll calm my stomach, but it’s just a Band-Aid for the bigger storm inside.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how this fear shapes your identity, relationships, and work. Let me offer a brief model: Your fear of losing yourself in the unknown may stem from a childhood trauma (the camping incident) and your mother’s unresolved reaction, which created a cycle of self-judgment and avoidance. Over time, this has led to physical symptoms, social withdrawal, and work challenges. Does this align with your experience, or would you like to correct or add to it?

patient: The model makes sense with the camping trip as a starting point, and I definitely avoid risks because of it. But I'm not sure about the 'unresolved reaction' part—I just remember my mom finding me and being relieved, maybe a little embarrassed. The worry loops and avoiding hikes/work risks are real, though. It’s like my brain replays the woods every time I plan anything uncertain.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying your mom’s reaction—it’s clear that her relief and subtle embarrassment shaped your self-perception without being fully addressed. Let me adjust the model: Your fear stems from the camping trauma and your mom’s unprocessed response, which contributed to self-judgment and avoidance. Does this revised model capture your experience, or is there more to refine?

patient: I think that model is partly right, but I want to add... the fear keeps growing not just from the camping trip or my mom’s reaction, but from how I’ve avoided risks ever since. Like, when I skip hikes or road trips, it’s like telling myself, ‘See? I can’t handle uncertainty.’ It’s like a loop. And my cousin isn’t around much, so I don’t even have someone to say, ‘Hey, you’re not broken.’ It’s like the fear gets louder when no one’s listening to the noise it’s making in my head.

interviewer: Thank you for adding those important pieces about the fear loop and the lack of support from your cousin. Let me integrate them into the model: Your fear of losing yourself to uncertainty is rooted in a childhood trauma, fueled by self-judgment from your mother’s unprocessed reaction, and maintained by avoidance behaviors that reinforce the fear. This creates a cycle where physical symptoms, social withdrawal, and work struggles feel inevitable. Does this feel accurate, or is there more to refine? If this aligns, what would be one step you’d be willing to take this week to challenge the fear loop—small or large?

patient: That model feels mostly accurate. The camping trip fear has definitely grown over time, and I guess my mom’s reaction did leave a mark—she kept checking on me so much after it happened that I felt like I was being judged for ‘acting out.’ But I think the loop is also fueled by how I punish myself now when I feel even slightly out of control. As for a step… I’ll try planning a short hike this week and commit to not canceling it, even if my heart races. I won’t bring the phone to check maps, just a compass. It’s small, but it’s something I haven’t done in years.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Patient reports persistent fear of getting lost since age 10 after a camping trip incident, with escalating anxiety around uncertainty. Describes panic attacks (racing heart, shaky hands, breathlessness) triggered by planning hikes, work risks, or minor life changes. Fear tied to identity loss: 'Terrified of becoming someone who isn’t me if I step into the unknown.' Recent work performance issues due to risk avoidance; social withdrawal from friends' trips. Uses OTC antacids and B-complex vitamins daily.

Objective: No acute distress observed. Patient denies hallucinations or suicidal ideation. Physical symptoms (tachycardia, diaphoresis) noted during anxiety episodes. Avoidance behaviors documented: refusing road trips, canceling hikes, avoiding work tasks with uncertainty.

Assessment: Chronic anxiety disorder (likely generalized anxiety with PTSD features from childhood trauma). Fear-maintaining cycle: trauma → self-judgment (mother's unresolved reaction) → avoidance → identity entrapment. Comorbid somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal distress). Low perceived social support.

Plan: Initiate trauma-focused CBT to address camping incident and maternal influence on self-perception. Gradual exposure: patient committed to planning a short hike without phone checks. Monitor OTC med use; consider SSRIs if symptoms persist. Weekly sessions to challenge fear loops and build risk-tolerance strategies.
