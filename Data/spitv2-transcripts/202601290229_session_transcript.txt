interviewer: Ryan, would you prefer I use your full name, Ryan Parker, or just Ryan during our session? And are there any pronouns you'd like me to use?

patient: Either is fine, I go by Ryan. I use he/him pronouns, and I'm 15, so I guess that's standard.

interviewer: It makes sense that balancing work and personal responsibilities can be stressful. So, Ryan, this session will focus on understanding your current concerns and how we can work together to support you. It typically lasts about 45 minutes. Are you comfortable proceeding with that?

patient: Yeah, I guess that's okay. I mean, I'm a little nervous, but I really want to figure some stuff out. The last few months have been tough keeping up with everything.

interviewer: It’s completely normal to feel a bit nervous—thank you for being open about it. Do you have any questions or concerns about how today’s session will work before we begin?

patient: I guess I’m just a bit nervous about... you know, talking about all this. But I want to figure things out. I hope we can work on the forgetfulness stuff and the self-doubt—it’s been making work and school kinda stressful lately.

interviewer: It’s okay to feel nervous—many people do at first. Just to confirm, are you comfortable proceeding with today’s session?

patient: Yeah, I guess so... I mean, I’m a little nervous, but I want to figure this out. My mind’s been so jumbled lately, and I don’t want to keep second-guessing myself all the time.

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: What are your hopes or goals for coming to counseling?

patient: I guess... I really just want to stop doubting myself all the time. Like, if I can learn to trust my memory more, that would help me focus at work and school without stressing over every small mistake. I also hope to feel less... overwhelmed by the whole thing. It’s kind of exhausting carrying this around every day.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that—it sounds like carrying this weight daily must be really tiring. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first started noticing these feelings of forgetfulness and self-doubt? Have they always been this intense, or have they gotten worse over time?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but I’ve always been a bit forgetful—I’d misplace my keys or forget homework deadlines. But over the past few months, it’s gotten worse. I’ll blank on simple things at work, like restocking shelves, and then obsess over it for hours. The self-criticism feels heavier now, like I’m constantly questioning if I’m even capable of handling responsibilities.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that—I can see how that level of self-criticism would take a toll. You mentioned it’s affecting your sleep and motivation—could you tell me more about how your sleep has been lately? Have you noticed any changes in how long you sleep, or how rested you feel in the morning?

patient: My sleep has been really off lately. I used to get about eight hours, but now I’m lucky if I get six. My mind races all night—I keep replaying mistakes I think I made at work or school, like forgetting to restock shelves or misspelling a customer’s name. I’ll lie awake for hours, then wake up feeling like I didn’t sleep at all. Last week, I panicked all night because I thought I’d lost a customer’s receipt, and I was so exhausted the next day I nearly fell asleep during my shift.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that—I can see how those sleepless nights would leave you feeling drained. Have you noticed any changes in your relationships with friends or family because of these worries about forgetting things or being overly self-critical?

patient: Yeah, I guess so... Like, I’ve started avoiding telling my friends or family about stuff I forget, because I don’t want them to think I’m just being lazy or ‘bad at life’—which is what I end up thinking about myself. My one close friend, Sam, notices when I seem off, but I haven’t told her how much this is actually messing with me. It’s kind of lonely, but I worry they’ll just tell me to ‘stop overthinking’ and that won’t fix anything.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of these thoughts is making it hard to share openly with others, which must add to the loneliness you're feeling. What have you found yourself doing to cope with these feelings of self-doubt and stress when they come up?

patient: I’ve been relying a lot on reminder apps and writing notes on my phone, but even with that, I second-guess everything. Sometimes I’ll call my best friend to confirm I didn’t forget a task at work, but it’s embarrassing because I’m not sure if it’s reasonable to ask. I’ve also caught myself staying up late replaying conversations in my head, thinking maybe I missed something important, even when there’s no proof I did.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Ryan, can you tell me if there have been any difficult or challenging experiences in your life that you think might be connected to these feelings of self-doubt or forgetfulness?

patient: Yeah... I think starting work at 15 added a lot of pressure. I’m trying to juggle shifts, school, and family stuff, but I’m scared I’ll mess up at the store and get reprimanded. My manager’s nice, but I overthink every task now—like if I restocked shelves wrong or forgot to clock in. It’s making me second-guess myself even when I’m not at work. I’m not sure if it’s the stress causing the forgetfulness or if my brain just feels like it’s failing at everything lately.

interviewer: It sounds like managing so many responsibilities is really wearing on you, Ryan. Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant adversity in your life that might be related to these feelings of self-doubt or stress?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced any major traumatic events. But the pressure of juggling retail work, school, and family expectations has felt overwhelming lately. I guess that’s the main adversity—like I’m constantly trying to prove I’m responsible, but my brain won’t cooperate. It’s made me hyper-focused on not messing up, which just makes me more anxious.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I want to ask a bit about your energy levels and sleep patterns. Have you noticed any times recently where you felt unusually energetic, had trouble sleeping, or engaged in risky behaviors that were out of character for you?

patient: I haven't felt unusually energetic lately—more like the opposite, honestly. My sleep has been messed up because I lie awake replaying all the things I 'forgot' or 'messed up' during the day. Some nights I don't fall asleep until 2 or 3 AM, and then I'm exhausted by noon. But I don't do anything reckless or out of character... I just feel like I'm stuck in this loop of overthinking and anxiety.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of mental weight with these worries. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or feeling like life isn't worth living? I ask because understanding this helps me support you better.

patient: No, I haven’t had thoughts of harming myself or feeling life isn’t worth living, but I’ve definitely felt really overwhelmed and stuck in my head lately. I just… I don’t want to give up, but sometimes it feels like I’m stuck in this loop of worrying about everything.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty, Ryan. It takes courage to share these challenges. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed very little sleep, or took risks that were out of character for you? This helps me understand if there might be patterns of elevated mood or behavior to consider.

patient: No, I don't think so. I've always been pretty consistent with my energy levels—maybe even the opposite, lately. I feel drained a lot, especially after work or school. I used to stay up late worrying about things, but it's more like my brain won't shut off than feeling energized. I don't take risks I wouldn't normally take; if anything, I'm more cautious about messing up.

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing a lot right now with work and school responsibilities. Have you used any substances like alcohol, cannabis, or other drugs recently? It's important for me to understand if any of these might be affecting how you're feeling.

patient: No, I haven’t used any substances like alcohol or cannabis. I’m trying to stay focused and not add anything else that might mess up my responsibilities or make me feel worse.

interviewer: It's brave of you to share these challenges, Ryan. Have you experienced any unusual sensations, thoughts, or beliefs that others might find strange or concerning—like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having ideas that feel hard to let go of even if they seem odd?

patient: No, I haven't heard voices or seen things that others don't. But sometimes I get stuck thinking about mistakes I *might* have made, like if I locked the store door or charged a customer right. It’s not about weird beliefs, but my brain replays these things so much it feels obsessive.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins on a regular basis? This helps me ensure there aren’t any interactions or side effects contributing to how you’re feeling.

patient: No, I'm not taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins right now. I haven't been prescribed anything for this—most of what I've tried is just apps and notes to stay on top of things.

interviewer: It's understandable that managing responsibilities can feel overwhelming. Have you experienced any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or head injuries that might be related to your current symptoms?

patient: No, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything like thyroid issues or head injuries. My doctor checked my general health during my last physical, and everything seemed normal. I’ve had trouble sleeping because I stress about everything, though. My mom says it’s just stress, but it feels like it’s making things worse.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Ryan, based on our conversation, it sounds like the stress of managing work, school, and family responsibilities has worsened your self-doubt and forgetfulness over the past few months. This cycle of anxiety about making mistakes seems to fuel obsessive rumination, disrupts your sleep, and impacts your confidence at work and school. Your use of reminders and cautiousness are strengths, but they might also be keeping you stuck in a loop of self-criticism. Does this capture your experience, or is there something I’m missing?

patient: Yeah, that’s pretty much it. The part about avoiding friends because I’m ashamed of being forgetful... it’s making me feel lonely, but I don’t know how to explain it to them without sounding like a failure. And I end up calling my friend just to make sure I didn’t mess up something, which feels embarrassing but I can’t help it. It’s like my brain won’t stop spiraling.

interviewer: It sounds like your brain’s spiral of self-criticism and need for reassurance is both a response to stress and a contributor to your isolation and exhaustion. Let me briefly outline a model: Predisposing factors might include your high standards and sensitivity to perceived mistakes; precipitating stressors could be the demands of work, school, and family expectations; perpetuating factors are the cycles of rumination, avoidance, and reassurance-seeking. Protective factors include your proactive coping strategies and supportive relationships. Does this align with your experience, or would you add anything to refine it?

patient: That model makes sense, especially the part about my work stress feeding into the spiral. I guess my fear of messing up at my job—like forgetting to restock or ringing up items correctly—makes me hyper-focused on every detail, but then I can’t stop replaying it. The ‘proactive’ stuff, like reminders, helps a little but feels embarrassing when I have to call my friend just to confirm I didn’t forget something. And yeah, the more I isolate, the more tired I get, which makes it harder to focus… it feels like a loop. Maybe the ‘predisposing’ part includes how I’ve always been a perfectionist, even in little things, like keeping my room spotless growing up?

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Ryan. It sounds like your perfectionism and stress are creating a cycle that’s hard to break. Let me make sure I’ve captured everything—what did I miss? Also, what would you like us to focus on next? Would you prefer strategies to manage the rumination, explore ways to build confidence in your memory, or something else?

patient: You mentioned perfectionism and stress, but I guess you might’ve missed how the shame makes me isolate even from the people who care about me, like my best friend. And maybe the way my brain fixates on tiny errors at work—like once I spilled a bottle and now I check every shelf three times. For next steps… I think learning to quiet the nighttime worrying would help me actually rest. If I could sleep without reliving every stupid mistake, maybe the daytime self-doubt wouldn’t be so bad. But also, I need to trust my memory again without relying on my phone or calling my friend to double-check everything—it feels so babyish.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden of shame and self-criticism, which isolates you even as it drains your energy and sleep. Let me check if I’ve captured everything—what did I miss? Also, what would be most helpful for us to focus on next, or is there anything else you’d like to add before we plan next steps?

patient: You got the main stuff, but maybe you didn’t mention how I *fear letting people down* even if I don’t make mistakes. Like, I’ll double-check a task 10 times because I’m scared someone’ll notice if I mess up, even if I did it right. What I’d want to focus on next is... maybe figuring out how to stop this cycle of doubting myself *before* it ruins my sleep or makes me shut out my friend, Liam. He’s the only one I can text at 2 AM without sounding like a mess.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that fear of letting others down—it adds an important layer to how self-doubt impacts your relationships. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else I’ve missed about how this cycle affects your life or priorities? For example, how might we balance addressing nighttime worrying with rebuilding trust in your memory during the day?

patient: The biggest thing I realize now is how my sleep issues and daytime self-doubt feed each other—it’s like a loop. When I can’t sleep, I’m more forgetful at work and school, which makes me overthink everything even more. My grades are slipping too, but I haven’t told my parents yet. I’m scared they’ll think I’m not trying. Also, I’ve been avoiding going out with friends because I worry I’ll forget something or mess up a conversation, but then I feel lonely and even more anxious. Maybe fixing the nighttime worrying could help me trust myself during the day, but I don’t know how to start.

interviewer: It’s clear how this cycle of sleep disruption and self-doubt is eroding your confidence and relationships. To finalize next steps, let’s confirm: we’ll prioritize strategies to break the nighttime worrying cycle and rebuild trust in your memory during the day, while also addressing the fear of letting others down. Would you prefer starting with cognitive-behavioral techniques for rumination, structured sleep hygiene practices, or something else? Also, is there anything else we haven’t covered that matters to you?

patient: I think starting with structured sleep hygiene practices would help first—like having a consistent bedtime routine, since my mind races until 2 or 3 a.m. Even small steps to calm my thoughts at night might free me up during the day to trust my memory more. But I also worry that the self-doubt itself is what keeps me up, so maybe combining it with techniques to challenge those thoughts? My job stress definitely fuels the cycle, but I’m not sure how to address that yet.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: 15-year-old male reports worsening forgetfulness, self-doubt, and anxiety over past 3-6 months, impacting work, school, and relationships. Sleep disrupted by obsessive rumination on perceived mistakes (e.g., restocking errors, customer receipts), resulting in 6 hours of restless sleep nightly. Avoids sharing struggles with friends/family due to shame, though confides in close friend 'Liam' during crises. Describes perfectionism, fear of letting others down, and hyper-vigilance at work (e.g., triple-checking shelves after minor past errors). No suicidal ideation or substance use.

Objective: Reports using reminder apps and calling friends for reassurance; avoids social interactions due to fear of appearing incompetent. Sleep hygiene compromised by 2-3 AM bedtimes. Academic performance declining; parents unaware. No medical conditions or medications reported.

Assessment: Chronic stress from work/school responsibilities exacerbating anxiety-driven rumination and sleep disturbance. Perfectionism and fear of failure perpetuate cycles of self-criticism, avoidance, and isolation. No psychotic features or substance use. Low-risk for self-harm but reports significant functional impairment (fatigue, declining performance, social withdrawal).

Plan: Prioritize structured sleep hygiene (consistent bedtime routine, thought-stopping techniques). Integrate cognitive-behavioral strategies to challenge self-doubt and reduce reassurance-seeking. Address work-related anxiety through graded exposure to task completion without perfectionism. Monitor academic impact; consider family communication planning. Re-evaluate in 2 weeks for symptom trajectory.
