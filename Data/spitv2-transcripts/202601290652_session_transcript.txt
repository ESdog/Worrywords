interviewer: May I have your name and preferred pronouns?

patient: My name is Pauline Emerson, and my pronouns are she/her.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Pauline. It takes courage to seek help for something that's impacting your passion and livelihood. Would you be comfortable if we proceed with today's session by discussing your current concerns and how we might work together to address them?

patient: Yes, I... I want to work through this. It's hard to talk about, but photography is such a big part of me, and I'm afraid of losing it. Even small mistakes now feel like disasters.

interviewer: It sounds like photography is deeply intertwined with your identity, and it's natural to feel vulnerable about those changes. Do you have any questions about how we'll work together or what to expect?

patient: To be honest, I’m not exactly sure what to expect. I’ve never talked to a therapist before, but I’m worried we’ll just keep circling around my camera breaking. I want to fix the self-criticism without avoiding responsibility… but maybe learning how to stop seeing one mistake as total failure? That’s the core, isn’t it?

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that insight, Pauline. It shows your commitment to growth. Does that sound like a good approach to you, or would you like to adjust anything before we begin?

patient: I think it's a solid approach—being honest about the camera situation really helps, but maybe we could also focus on rebuilding confidence in my craft? It feels like that’s where the self-doubt roots itself the most.

interviewer: It’s clear how important rebuilding confidence is to you, Pauline. Before we move forward, is there anything else you’d like to ask about how we’ll approach this work together?

patient: I guess I’d like to know how we can work on those automatic thoughts when I mess up. Like, when the lens broke, my mind just spiraled into thinking I’m a failure. Can we learn to catch that spiral before it takes over my whole day?

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Pauline. It takes courage to confront these challenges, and it's clear how deeply your identity is tied to your craft. Looking ahead, what would you most hope to achieve through our work together? What outcomes would feel meaningful for you?

patient: I hope to learn how to stop spiraling into self-criticism when something goes wrong—like with the camera lens—and rebuild my confidence without relying on perfection. It would mean a lot to feel like mistakes are just part of the process, not proof I’m failing. I also want to reconnect with why I love photography in the first place, not just the results. Maybe even find ways to enjoy small successes again, instead of always waiting for ‘perfect’ moments.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those meaningful goals, Pauline. It sounds like this lens incident became a turning point for you. Can you tell me a bit more about when the camera lens broke—what was happening in your life around that time, and how did your feelings about photography begin to shift after that?

patient: It happened during a client shoot for a family portrait. I was in a rush to set up before sunset, and I dropped the camera adjusting the lens. The main lens cracked instantly. I felt so humiliated—I’d promised them vibrant, sharp images, and now the gear was ruined. At first, I tried to downplay it, saying I’d use a backup, but the photos that day looked flat compared to my usual work. That night, I kept thinking, *What if this means I’m losing my eye for detail? What if I’m not as good as I thought?* It’s like the lens breaking became this... physical symbol of my fear that I’m faking it. I’ve avoided major jobs since, and when I do shoot, I scrutinize every shot like it’s proof of my failure.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that vulnerable moment, Pauline. It sounds like this incident amplified fears you may have carried about your abilities. How has this self-doubt affected your daily life beyond your photography work—like hobbies or routines you once enjoyed, such as gardening or baking?

patient: Well, I used to lose myself in my garden, but now I barely tend to the plants. I used to bake for my friends’ gatherings, but I canceled last week—couldn’t face the thought of making something imperfect. It’s like... if my photos aren’t flawless, what’s the point of anything else? I even snapped at my neighbor when she asked about the roses. I don’t want to be this bitter, but it’s hard to see joy in anything when I feel like a failure.

interviewer: I hear how challenging it is to feel this bitterness and distance from the joy you once found in your passions. What have you tried so far to manage these feelings of self-criticism and doubt, and how effective have those strategies been for you?

patient: I’ve mostly tried telling myself that one mistake doesn’t define me, but it doesn’t really stick. Like, when the lens broke, I kept thinking, ‘You’re supposed to be good at this,’ and it just made me feel worse. I tried reaching out to a few photographer friends, but I ended up downplaying how bad it felt—probably because I didn’t want them to think I’m ‘weak’ or something. It’s not helping much, honestly. The self-criticism just… loops.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about how these feelings have taken hold, Pauline. It sounds like the self-criticism has become relentless and isolating. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite since these feelings began, or moments when the self-criticism feels especially intense?

patient: My sleep’s been worse, yeah—I’ll lie awake replaying the lens incident or second-guessing old photos. Appetite’s down too; some days I forget to eat. The self-criticism usually spikes when I’m alone editing photos or when a client asks for something I’m unsure about. It’s like the camera breaking unlocked a switch I can’t turn off.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Pauline. I want to ask about your safety: Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself recently?

patient: No, I haven’t had thoughts like that, but I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I love photography so much that the idea of losing it feels unbearable, which probably keeps me from thinking that way. But there are days when I feel stuck in a loop of self-criticism, and it’s exhausting.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness, Pauline. It sounds like the self-criticism loop is particularly draining. Let’s shift focus slightly: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or energy levels recently—like needing less sleep or feeling unusually restless/overly energetic?

patient: Yes, my sleep has gotten worse. I’ve been lying awake for hours at night, replaying the camera incident and obsessing over photos I’ve taken. When I do sleep, I wake up exhausted and irritable. It’s made my energy levels plummet—I used to stay up editing with no problem, but now even simple tasks feel draining.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing the impact this is having on your energy and sleep. Let’s move to another area: Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances recently—either increasing, decreasing, or starting/stoppping use?

patient: No, I haven't noticed any changes in my use of alcohol or cannabis lately. I don’t typically use substances, and I’ve been trying to manage stress through my usual routines, though they’ve not been very effective.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the stress and sleep challenges. To better understand your symptoms, have you experienced any periods lately where you felt unusually energetic, had a lot of ideas racing through your mind, or taken risks you wouldn’t normally take—even for creative projects?

patient: No, I haven’t felt unusually energetic or had racing ideas lately. If anything, I’ve been exhausted from overthinking every photo I take. The only time I feel restless is when I’m obsessively reviewing past work, trying to find flaws that weren’t there before—like I’m punishing myself for the lens incident.

interviewer: I appreciate your detailed insights, Pauline. Let’s address another key area: Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently that feel concerning—like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or feeling someone is targeting you in a specific way?

patient: No, I haven't experienced hallucinations or delusions. My struggles are more with relentless self-criticism that feels so vivid it's almost like an internal monologue I can't silence. But no voices, visions, or conspiratorial thoughts—just... a very harsh inner critic that's gotten louder since the camera incident.

interviewer: I appreciate your clarity about the nature of your self-criticism. Let’s briefly cover one final area for now: Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins on a regular basis, or have you started or stopped any recently?

patient: No, I’m not taking any medications or supplements regularly. I’ve never needed them, and nothing’s changed recently in that regard. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but it’s not a daily habit.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you're facing with sleep and energy. Let’s briefly cover another area: Have you been diagnosed with or experienced any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or a head injury that might be contributing to how you’re feeling now?

patient: No, I haven’t been diagnosed with any of those medical conditions. My struggles with sleep and energy seem tied more to the stress and self-criticism from the camera incident. I’ve always been healthy—this feels like it’s coming from my mind, not my body.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I want to make sure I’ve captured this accurately: It sounds like the broken camera lens acted as a trigger (precipitating factor) for your current struggles, which are rooted in long-standing perfectionism and identity tied to your photography (predisposing factors). The self-criticism and avoidance of work/hobbies are now keeping things stuck (perpetuating factors), but your willingness to seek help and your passion for creating are strengths that can help you move forward (protective factors). What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: That’s a really good summary, thank you for putting it so clearly. The broken lens during the client shoot was definitely the trigger—it felt like a public failure, which hit hard because my identity is so tied to my work. The perfectionism has always been there, but I didn’t realize how much it was feeding this spiral of self-criticism. I do think the avoidance of jobs and hobbies is keeping me stuck, and yes, my passion for creating is still there, even if it’s buried under the self-doubt. I think you missed how much I’m snapping at others when I’m overwhelmed, but otherwise, that’s spot on. It’s reassuring to hear it framed like that—maybe seeing the factors helps me not feel so alone in this.

interviewer: Thank you for that clarification about snapping at others—I'll make sure to include that in our model. Now, thinking ahead, what would you most like to focus on next in our work together? Are there specific goals or areas you'd prefer we prioritize as we move forward?

patient: I think the biggest hurdle is learning to interrupt that relentless inner critic when it kicks in—especially after mistakes like the camera lens. I’d like to build tools to challenge those thoughts in real time, instead of spiraling. Also, reconnecting with why I started photography in the first place, before perfectionism took over, might help me separate my worth from my work. If we could work on practical strategies for both the self-criticism and rebuilding small, consistent confidence in my skills, that would help me stop freezing up and start enjoying the process again.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those priorities—focusing on interrupting self-critical patterns and reconnecting with your creative purpose feels like a strong foundation. To move forward, I’d propose we start with structured cognitive restructuring exercises to challenge perfectionism in real time, paired with gradual exposure to photography tasks to rebuild confidence. Would that align with your goals, and is there anything else you’d like to add to this plan?

patient: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I’m willing to try challenging those negative thoughts, but I’m nervous about the exposure part—what if I fail again? Also, maybe we could incorporate something about reconnecting with my garden? It used to calm me, but I’ve let it go wild from neglect, just like my confidence feels now.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Patient reports self-criticism spiraling after camera lens broke during a client shoot, leading to perfectionism, identity tied to photography, and fear of losing creative confidence. Sleep disrupted (insomnia, exhaustion), reduced appetite, irritability, and social withdrawal (e.g., canceled baking events). Denies suicidal ideation but describes feeling 'stuck' in self-criticism loops. Notable quote: 'If my photos aren’t flawless, what’s the point of anything else?'

Objective: Observable impacts: Avoided photography jobs, neglected gardening, and withdrew from social activities. Sleep disturbances documented (reduced quantity/quality). No substance use or medical conditions reported. Patient acknowledges perfectionism as a long-standing factor.

Assessment: Precipitating factor: Camera lens incident triggered acute self-criticism. Predisposing factors: Perfectionism and identity tied to work. Perpetuating factors: Avoidance, rumination, and self-sabotage. Protective factors: Motivation to engage, creative passion. No acute risk; chronic anxiety with potential depressive features.

Plan: Cognitive restructuring for perfectionism, gradual exposure to photography tasks, and reconnecting with hobbies (e.g., gardening). Monitor sleep and energy. Address interpersonal strain (e.g., snapping at others). Patient agrees to prioritize interrupting self-criticism patterns and rebuilding confidence through small creative successes.
