interviewer: May I have your preferred name and pronouns?

patient: My name is Nathan Armstrong, and my pronouns are he/him.

interviewer: Thank you, Nathan. It sounds like adjusting to a new country has been challenging lately. Today, we'll be discussing your current concerns and how we can support you. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yes, I need help with this. It’s been overwhelming trying to find work here and... I guess I’m scared I’ll never fit in or make connections. The job search feels impossible sometimes.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Nathan. Do you have any questions about how we can support you or what this process involves?

patient: I guess I'm just wondering what the next steps are or what kind of help is available here. I want to feel like I can get back to job searching without it being so overwhelming all the time.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Nathan. Are you comfortable proceeding with this process today?

patient: Yes, I’d like to. It’s been tough adjusting here, and these thoughts don’t let up, so… I need to try to work through this.

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I appreciate your courage in reaching out and sharing these challenges. To better support you, could you share what you most hope to achieve through our work together—whether it’s easing specific worries, improving daily functioning, or something else?

patient: I want to feel less paralyzed by the fear of never finding a job or connecting with people here. The anxiety makes it hard to even start my job search or put myself out there socially. I guess my main hope is learning how to manage these overwhelming thoughts so I can function better daily and stop catastrophizing my future in Sweden.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing your hopes for our work together, Nathan. To better understand the timeline of your concerns, can you tell me a bit more about when these feelings of fear and anxiety first started for you, and how they’ve changed over time since you moved to Sweden?

patient: The feelings started shortly after I moved to Sweden—maybe around two or three months ago. At first, the stress was manageable, but it kept building. Now, every time I look for jobs or feel isolated here, it’s like the fear snowballs. It’s constant, even when I’m trying to rest. I can’t shake the thought that I’m failing at everything. It’s worse than when I first arrived, honestly. I’ve tried telling myself things will get better, but it’s not helping.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I appreciate your openness, Nathan. It sounds like adjusting to a new country while navigating job search challenges is creating a lot of strain. Have you experienced any traumatic or particularly difficult events in your past that you think might be connected to your current challenges with adjusting to Sweden or your job search?

patient: No, I don't think there are specific traumatic events from my past that stand out here. This is my first time living abroad, and the adjustment has been harder than I anticipated. I’ve always been able to manage stress before, but the job search and isolation feel like a whole new kind of pressure I’m not used to.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress of adjusting to Sweden and job search challenges are central to your current struggles. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety or stress in the past that were challenging for you?

patient: No, not really. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, but nothing like this before. The stress of past job changes or relocations never felt this... all-consuming. It’s more like the whole foundation of my life feels shaky now, you know? Like losing things isn’t just about forgetting keys—it’s about my future, my identity, everything collapsing.

interviewer: It sounds like you're navigating a lot alone right now. Have you found any community groups, coworkers, or other individuals in Sweden who you feel connected to, even if they’re not close friends?

patient: Not really—most of the people I’ve met are just acquaintances from the gym or occasional language exchanges. I try to keep things professional or surface-level because I’m too anxious to let anyone get close. It feels like no one would actually care if I failed anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure of building a life in a new place without close connections is compounding your anxiety. Do you have family members or other support systems you can rely on, even if they're not in Sweden?

patient: No, there's no family here in Sweden. My parents and siblings are back in the UK, but the distance makes it hard to lean on them. I've tried video calls, but it's not the same as having someone nearby. I have a few people I know here, but they're just casual acquaintances—I don't feel comfortable opening up about this stuff with them.

interviewer: It sounds like the distance from your family adds to the isolation. Do you have a family history of mental health challenges, such as anxiety or depression, that might be relevant to your current situation?

patient: I don't think so. My family hasn't really talked about mental health stuff before. My mom always got really stressed during big life changes, like when I was starting college, but she never had a diagnosis or anything. It's hard to say if that's genetic or just how we cope, though.

interviewer: It sounds like you're navigating a complex transition with resilience. What do you think has helped you cope with these challenges so far, even in small ways?

patient: Trying to set small, manageable goals each day has helped a bit, like focusing on one job application at a time. Also, I’ve tried to reach out to acquaintances here occasionally, even if it feels forced. It’s not much, but it keeps me from completely shutting down.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how overwhelming this transition has been. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts about harming myself, but the fear of losing everything—like my future here or becoming completely isolated—feels like a heavy weight I can't shake. It's more like my anxiety is suffocating, making me question if I'll ever adapt or feel stable again.

interviewer: I understand how isolating and stressful this period must feel. Have you noticed any periods where you feel overly energetic, need less sleep, or take risks you wouldn't normally take, even briefly?

patient: No, not really. I've been feeling more like the opposite—drained, even when I'm not doing anything. My anxiety keeps me up sometimes, but it's more restlessness than energy. I don't take risks... if anything, I'm hyper-cautious about everything now.

interviewer: I hear how isolating and uncertain this time feels for you. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances recently, either to cope with stress or for other reasons?

patient: I haven’t used cannabis or other substances, but I’ve been drinking alcohol more than usual lately—probably as a way to unwind. It’s not heavy, just... more than I used to in the past. I don’t think I’ve crossed into anything problematic yet.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the alcohol use and your efforts to manage it. Have you experienced any unusual thoughts, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or feeling paranoid that people are watching or plotting against you, even briefly?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced hearing voices or seeing things. But sometimes I feel like people are judging me or talking about me when I’m job searching, which adds to the anxiety. It’s more like... self-consciousness than paranoia, I think.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about these challenges. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or over-the-counter remedies for your anxiety or any other concerns?

patient: No, I’m not currently taking any medications or supplements for anxiety or other issues. I’ve tried positive self-talk and distraction techniques, but they haven’t really helped ease the anxiety I’m feeling about job searching and adjusting here.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the alcohol use. Have you used any other substances, such as stimulants, opioids, or prescription medications not related to anxiety, in the past few months?

patient: No, I haven’t used any other substances besides maybe the occasional caffeine to stay awake, but nothing else. I’ve been trying to avoid anything that might make things worse, honestly.

interviewer: I appreciate your efforts to manage these challenges without turning to harmful substances. Can you share more about what helps you feel most supported or resilient during difficult moments, even if it’s small things?

patient: Honestly, the smallest things help—like setting tiny goals for myself, even if it’s just sending one job application or saying hi to an acquaintance. It keeps me from completely shutting down. Sometimes I force myself to take a short walk, which weirdly helps clear my head a little. And I try to call my sister back home, even though I hate how heavy my voice sounds when I talk about this. Those moments feel... temporary, but they’re something.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: What I’ve heard so far is that moving to Sweden has triggered anxieties about job insecurity and social isolation, which have grown over time into a fear of losing everything. These worries feel overwhelming, making it hard to focus on daily tasks or connect with others, even though you’re using small coping strategies like setting goals and reaching out. Your history suggests this is a new stress response to a major life change, with no prior mental health struggles. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: That’s mostly accurate, but maybe you missed the part about me drinking more alcohol to unwind—though I don’t think it’s ‘a problem’ yet. Also, the fear isn’t just about the future; it feels like I’m already losing time, like every day I’m slipping further behind. The small coping strategies help a little, but they’re like putting bandaids on broken legs. And the sleep… it’s not just disrupted—I often don’t remember falling asleep, which adds to the fear of losing control over even basic things. Everything else you said rings true, though.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re navigating a complex mix of adjustment stress, cultural adaptation, and isolation, with alcohol use temporarily filling a gap in coping. Let me offer a tentative model: Predisposing factors might include your proactive nature and sensitivity to life transitions, while precipitating stressors are the recent move and job search challenges. Perpetuating factors could be the cycle of anxiety, sleep disruption, and isolation, while protective factors include your structured coping attempts and willingness to seek help. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I agree with the model overall, but I’d add that cultural adaptation itself—like navigating unfamiliar job market norms and language nuances—is a huge stressor that feeds into the anxiety cycle. Also, the lack of a strong support network here is definitely a perpetuating factor. My structured coping attempts are there, but they feel fragile. I don’t know if they’re enough to break the cycle.

interviewer: Thank you for those important additions about cultural adaptation and the lack of a support network. It sounds like we have a clearer, more complete picture now. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You didn’t miss much, but maybe you didn’t highlight how much I rely on tiny coping strategies—like short walks or calling my sister briefly—to keep from shutting down completely. Also, I mentioned drinking more alcohol to unwind, but I didn’t emphasize how much it’s crept into my routine. Other than that, the summary feels accurate. The hyper-awareness of others judging me during job searches might not have come through clearly either.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying the role of alcohol use and social judgment in your experience—it’s important we address these as part of our next steps. Looking ahead, what would you most like to focus on in our work together? For example, would you prefer to explore therapy approaches, consider lifestyle adjustments, or build a support network here in Sweden?

patient: I’d most want to focus on therapy approaches to tackle the anxiety and catastrophizing—like learning to reframe these thoughts when job searching or feeling isolated. Building a support network sounds important too, but I’m not sure where to start there. Maybe we could work on practical steps for both?

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve aligned on prioritizing therapy approaches to address anxiety and catastrophizing, alongside exploring practical steps for building a support network here. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust about our plan?

patient: I think that plan makes sense, but maybe adding some guidance on navigating the Swedish job market specifically would help—like cultural expectations or resources for expats. Also, I’ve been using alcohol more to unwind, so I wonder if that’s something we should address. Other than that, the focus on therapy and connections feels right, but I’m still worried about how to start rebuilding confidence in my abilities here.

interviewer: I appreciate you highlighting the role of alcohol use and the need for Swedish job market guidance—they’re important additions to our plan. Before we finalize, is there anything else you’d like to include or adjust about our next steps?

patient: I think that covers the main areas, but maybe adding structured routines for daily tasks and job searches could help me feel more in control. Also, guidance on building local connections without overexerting myself would be helpful—like how to engage with community groups without feeling judged. I’d also appreciate practical advice on managing anxiety during job applications, since the fear of rejection feels paralyzing right now.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Nathan reports anxiety, fear of job insecurity, social isolation, and catastrophizing his future in Sweden. Symptoms began 2-3 months post-move, worsening over time with sleep disruption, self-consciousness during job searches, and alcohol use for unwinding. Feels 'paralyzed by fear,' 'slipping further behind daily,' and 'losing control over basic things.'

Objective: No suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or substance misuse beyond increased alcohol consumption (not yet problematic). No prior mental health diagnoses or trauma history. Family history of stress reactivity during life transitions. Uses small coping strategies (goal-setting, short walks, calling family) with limited efficacy.

Assessment: Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood likely secondary to cultural adaptation stressors, job search challenges, and social isolation. Perpetuating factors include anxiety cycles, sleep disruption, and lack of local support. Protective factors include proactive coping attempts and willingness to engage.

Plan: Prioritize CBT for anxiety management and catastrophizing; explore Swedish job market resources for expats. Address alcohol use as coping mechanism. Develop structured routines for job search and daily tasks. Facilitate gradual social engagement strategies (e.g., low-pressure community groups). Monitor sleep patterns and anxiety triggers during applications.
