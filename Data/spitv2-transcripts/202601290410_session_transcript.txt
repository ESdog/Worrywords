interviewer: Thank you for coming in, Kendra. To start, may I use your name and pronouns as you’ve shared, or would you prefer something else?

patient: Yes, that's fine. I just... I don't really know why they chose me, but my friends have always been supportive. It's just hard to believe they still feel that way lately.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like these feelings can be really overwhelming. Before we move forward, would you be comfortable with me briefly explaining how our time together will work and then checking in if this feels okay with you?

patient: Yes, that sounds okay. I appreciate knowing what to expect... I’ve just been so anxious lately, even about talking about these things.

interviewer: It’s completely valid to feel anxious when discussing challenging topics—we’ll take things at your pace. Before we begin, do you have any questions about how we’ll spend our time today or anything else on your mind?

patient: No specific questions right now... I think I’m just nervous about talking about these things. The scooter rides used to relax me, but lately even that feels like a chore.

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

interviewer: Can you tell me more about what's been most troubling for you lately and how it's been affecting your life?

patient: The worst part is this constant fear that my friends are pulling away from me, even though they’ve always been supportive. Since the party incident, I’ve been dreading social plans and second-guessing every text they send. It’s making me withdraw, which just fuels the cycle of thinking they’ll abandon me. I used to love riding my scooter to clear my head, but now even that feels like a chore because I’m too stuck in these negative thoughts.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how isolating these thoughts feel, especially with something you once enjoyed like riding your scooter. Can you tell me when these feelings of worthlessness and fear of abandonment first started, and how they’ve changed since the party incident?

patient: The feelings started about a week ago after the party. I’ve always had moments of worrying about being left out, but this time it’s worse—my thoughts spiral when I see their social media posts or hear about the party. I used to call them to ask about plans, but now I freeze up and assume they’d be annoyed. The scooter rides feel different too; I used to ride to clear my head, but lately, I just sit there staring at the handlebars, not sure if I can even do that right.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how isolating these thoughts feel, especially with something you once enjoyed like riding your scooter. It sounds like this fear of abandonment has become overwhelming lately. What are your hopes or goals for coming to counseling right now? Are there specific changes you’d like to see in how you feel or function in daily life?

patient: Honestly, I just want to feel like myself again—the person who could enjoy little things, like riding my scooter without dreading it. I guess I hope counseling can help me stop spiraling into these thoughts that I’m unlovable or that people are avoiding me. Maybe... learning how to trust that my friends truly care, even when I feel left out? That sounds silly, but it’s eating at me.

interviewer: It makes sense to want to rebuild trust in relationships, especially when uncertainty feels so heavy. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite since these thoughts started creeping in?

patient: Yeah, my sleep’s been all over the place. I’ll either lie awake for hours worrying about what my friends think of me or just crash early and then feel groggy all day. As for eating… I’ve been skipping meals sometimes because I don’t feel hungry, but other times I’ll overeat junk food late at night when I’m trying to distract myself. It’s not consistent, but it’s definitely not healthy.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I want to understand more about your history. Have you experienced similar feelings of worthlessness or fear of abandonment in the past, even briefly?

patient: No, not really... I’ve always had close friends, and I never questioned their support before. It’s this recent party incident that feels different—it’s like a switch flipped. I guess I’ve always been a little shy, but this anxiety over being excluded is new. Even when I was younger, I didn’t dwell on people leaving me. Now it’s constant, though. Even when they do include me, I second-guess it.

interviewer: It sounds like this recent incident has brought up some long-standing worries about being excluded or unloved. I’d like to gently explore if there were any difficult experiences in your past—maybe during childhood or adolescence—that might relate to these feelings, even if they seem unrelated at first? This could help us understand patterns better.

patient: I... I don’t remember any big traumas, but honestly, I’ve always been really sensitive about being ‘not enough’ in some way. In high school, there was this one time I wasn’t invited to a class trip, even though I asked. I convinced myself they thought I’d be boring. But they still hung out with me afterward, so maybe I overthought it. It’s weird—this recent party situation feels kind of like that, but worse? I don’t know if it’s connected… or if I’m just imagining things.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself in the past week?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts about ending my life or harming myself specifically in the past week. But I do feel... overwhelmed sometimes when these negative thoughts consume me, like I'm trapped in this cycle of self-doubt.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that—it sounds like these thoughts can feel really heavy. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns lately, like feeling unusually restless or needing less sleep than usual?

patient: Yeah, my sleep has been all over the place lately. I’ll either lie awake for hours worrying about what my friends are doing or just crash and sleep way too much, which leaves me groggy. It’s like my brain can’t decide if it wants rest or not. And I feel... heavier, like my body’s dragging even when I’m not doing anything.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about how exhausting this has been. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic, impulsive, or like you don’t need much sleep, even if you’re already tired?

patient: No, I haven’t noticed anything like that. My sleep issues are more about either lying awake for hours worrying or just collapsing into bed and oversleeping, but I don’t feel energized or impulsive. I’ve been really drained lately, honestly.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of emotional weight lately. To better understand your current state, have you used any substances—like alcohol, cannabis, or others—to cope with these feelings recently?

patient: No, I haven’t used any substances to cope with this. I’ve tried things like riding my scooter or focusing on work, but the anxiety still lingers, and those activities don’t really take my mind off things anymore.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about these challenges. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or experiencing thoughts that feel foreign or paranoid?

patient: No, I haven’t heard voices or seen things that others don’t. But sometimes I catch myself thinking... like, *maybe I’m imagining they’re avoiding me*, even when there’s no real evidence. It’s more like my mind races with 'what ifs'—like I’m certain they’re talking bad about me, even when they’re just texting normally. It feels... intrusive, but not like voices or anything. The high school class trip memory keeps popping into my head too, making me wonder if I’m 'overthinking' again.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about these thoughts. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones, that you’d like to share?

patient: I’m not currently taking any medications or supplements for this—just trying to manage it on my own so far. I’ve thought about maybe trying something over-the-counter for the anxiety, but I haven’t tried anything yet... a friend mentioned melatonin for sleep, but I don’t know if that’s related.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Kendra, based on our conversation, it sounds like the recent party incident has intensified long-standing fears of being unlovable or unworthy, especially when linked to a past experience of being excluded in high school. These thoughts seem to fuel anxiety, disrupt your sleep and enjoyment of activities like scooter riding, and make it harder to reach out to friends. The good news is you have supportive relationships and a strong motivation to regain your usual self. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience so far?

patient: You captured the main points well, but you didn’t mention how my eating habits have also thrown off—I’ve been skipping meals or eating junk late at night, which makes me feel worse physically. Also, I think you might’ve missed that I’m not sure if my high school memory is *connected* to this or if I’m just overthinking again. I’m trying to handle things alone, even considering OTC sleep aids like melatonin, but it’s not helping much. The rest feels right.

interviewer: Kendra, considering your additions about disrupted eating patterns and the high school memory, would you say this updated model reflects your experience accurately, or is there anything else I’ve overlooked? For example, how do you see the connection between your current stress and those late-night eating habits?

patient: I think you’re right about the connection—when I’m too anxious to sleep, I end up mindlessly eating like it’s the only thing keeping me awake or distracted. It’s like my brain can’t decide if I’m stressed or hungry, so I do both. The high school memory feels like a shadow over it all… like I’m stuck in that same pattern of convincing myself I’m ‘uninvited’ now, but this time it’s my own body I’m punishing with late-night junk food instead of just sitting alone in my room.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that connection—it’s clear how these patterns feel cyclical yet deeply tied to your sense of control. To ensure we’re aligned, let me briefly summarize: Your current struggles with anxiety, sleep disruption, and compulsive eating seem to stem from a mix of recent social stressors (like the party incident), long-standing fears of abandonment, and a high school memory that still influences how you interpret exclusion. These factors create a cycle where physical habits (like eating) and emotional reactions reinforce each other. What did I miss or get wrong here, and are there other elements you’d like to add before we discuss next steps?

patient: Thank you for summarizing—I think you captured the main points well. One thing you might’ve slightly missed is that my eating isn’t exactly ‘compulsive’ but more irregular; I either skip meals or eat junk late at night, less out of compulsion than... distraction. Also, the high school memory about the class trip feels especially vivid now because I’m starting to wonder if I’m just ‘prone’ to these cycles of thinking I’m being excluded. I guess I’d also add that my exhaustion from sleep issues makes everything worse, but I’ve resisted using substances or anything drastic, even OTC stuff. I’m scared it’ll just keep spiraling like it did back then.

interviewer: Thank you for those clarifications—they help me see how distraction, not compulsion, drives your eating patterns, and how the high school memory resurfaces as a lens for current fears. Before we plan next steps, is there anything else about your experience or these patterns that feels important to add or correct?

patient: I think what I’ve shared covers the main things, but maybe the high school memory is a bigger piece than I realized. It feels like a pattern of doubting others’ intentions, which makes me wonder if that’s part of what I need to untangle. Also, I guess I’d like to clarify that while I’m not impulsive, the exhaustion from my sleep issues is making it harder to focus on anything—even my scooter rides feel like I’m dragging through mud. I just want to feel like my thoughts aren’t always circling back to ‘what if they really don’t care.’

interviewer: Kendra, to ensure we’re aligned, here’s a concise model: Your current struggles—social anxiety, sleep disruption, irregular eating, and cyclical thoughts about abandonment—stem from a mix of recent stressors (like the party incident), a high school memory that still influences your self-perception, and exhaustion amplifying your anxiety. Protective factors include your supportive friendships and proactive coping attempts like reaching out. What did I miss or get wrong here, and are there other elements you’d like to add before we discuss next steps like therapy goals or strategies to address these patterns?

patient: You captured most of it accurately. I’d add that the exhaustion feels like my brain is constantly running, even when I’m trying to rest—like a storm inside my head that leaves me physically drained. I’ve been taking melatonin to try to sleep, but it just makes me groggy without really helping. Also, the high school memory isn’t just a flash—it’s this nagging voice that keeps whispering, ‘You’re right back here again, aren’t you?’ I guess I didn’t mention that my work has gotten harder to focus on too, but I keep pushing through. Oh, and I should clarify—I haven’t used any substances to cope, even though it’s tempting sometimes. It’s just me and these thoughts… and my scooter, which I can’t even enjoy now.

interviewer: Thank you for adding those details about the storm-like exhaustion and the persistent high school memory—it’s clear how these elements intertwine with your current stress. To move forward, what would you like to prioritize in our next steps? For example, would you prefer focusing on sleep strategies, exploring thought patterns around abandonment, or addressing work-related focus? Are there other preferences I should know about?

patient: I think working on the thought patterns around abandonment would help me the most right now—especially linking that high school memory to how I’m feeling now. It’s like I’m stuck in this loop of ‘proving’ I’m unlovable, even when my friends clearly care. If we could untangle that, maybe my sleep and energy would improve too. But I’d also appreciate some practical sleep tips, since the exhaustion feels like it’s making everything worse.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Kendra reports persistent anxiety and fear of abandonment since a recent party incident (1 week ago), with worsening social withdrawal, disrupted sleep (insomnia/oversleeping), and irregular eating (skipping meals, late-night junk food). She describes cyclical negative thoughts about being 'unlovable,' linking current struggles to a high school memory of exclusion (class trip). Notes exhaustion as 'a storm inside my head' and physical fatigue impacting daily activities like scooter riding. Denies suicidal ideation or substance use.

Objective: Reports sleep disturbances (variable duration, grogginess), irregular eating patterns, and reduced engagement in previously enjoyable activities. Observes self-described 'storm-like exhaustion' and intrusive thoughts about social rejection. Melatonin used for sleep with minimal benefit.

Assessment: Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood likely exacerbated by recent social stressor (party incident) and reactivated by high school exclusion memory. Protective factors include supportive friendships and proactive coping attempts. Cyclical thought patterns around abandonment and self-doubt contribute to functional decline (sleep, appetite, social engagement).

Plan: Prioritize CBT for cognitive distortions around abandonment, linking past/present experiences. Implement sleep hygiene strategies and monitor melatonin effects. Explore behavioral activation for re-engagement with scooter rides. Schedule follow-up to assess symptom trajectory and consider adjunctive tools for anxiety management.
