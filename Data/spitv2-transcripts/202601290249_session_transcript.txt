interviewer: Thank you for sharing your intake form details, Laura. To start, can you share your preferred name and pronouns with me?

patient: You can call me Laura. I use she/her pronouns.

interviewer: Thank you, Laura. Today’s session will focus on understanding your concerns and how we might work together to address them. We’ll discuss your experiences, goals, and any questions you have. Does that sound okay to you?

patient: Yes, that sounds okay. I appreciate the opportunity to work on these issues—I’ve been avoiding talking about them much, but I’m ready to try figuring out how to manage the anxiety they cause.

interviewer: Great to hear you're ready to work on this. Before we dive in, is there anything specific you’d like to ask me about how we’ll approach this work together?

patient: I guess I’d like to know what kind of approach you typically take with issues like self-confidence and anxiety in social situations. Have you worked with people who have similar concerns before?

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like these thoughts have been really challenging, especially in social settings. Can you share a recent example of when these feelings came up for you and how they affected what you did in that moment?

patient: Last week, I went on a date with someone I met online. As soon as we met, I started feeling self-conscious about my height—I kept crossing my arms and standing a little back from him to avoid eye contact. I couldn’t relax, and I think he got uncomfortable too. We didn’t talk much, and I left feeling like I’d ruined it. It felt like yet another confirmation that people only see my height first, not who I am.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that experience—it sounds deeply isolating to feel like your height defines how others see you. When did these feelings about your height impacting your confidence and relationships first start for you, and how have they changed over time?

patient: I think these feelings started for me probably in my early 20s, after a few romantic rejections where people subtly or not-so-subtly mentioned my height as a dealbreaker. At first, it felt like isolated incidents, but over time, the pattern stuck in my head. Now it’s more constant—like I can’t meet someone new without my brain instantly bracing for judgment. The anxiety feels sharper than before, and I’ve started avoiding dating altogether to 'protect' myself, which just makes me feel more alone.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how past rejections have shaped these feelings. Can you tell me if there have been other times in your life when your anxiety about your height felt similarly overwhelming, and what helped (or didn’t help) during those periods?

patient: Yes, in college during group projects, I’d get super self-conscious about my height when meeting teammates in person. I’d cross my arms or slouch to ‘disappear,’ but it just made me more anxious. Distraction helped temporarily—focusing on the work—but the fear lingered. My roommate once joked about my posture, which made me feel exposed, so I avoided explaining it. It ended up isolating me, but I didn’t know how to talk about it even with close friends.

interviewer: It sounds like your experiences in college left a lasting mark on how you relate to others. Could you share a bit about your closest relationships or support system today—like friends, family, or others who you feel connected to? And are there any current stressors or challenges that might be contributing to these feelings now?

patient: My closest relationships are with a few close friends, but honestly, I haven’t opened up to them about these specific insecurities—it feels too vulnerable. We get along well, but I tend to keep my guard up in deeper conversations. As for stressors, the loneliness from avoiding dating is definitely weighing on me, and I feel this constant background worry that I’ll misread someone’s reaction and spiral into self-doubt. It’s like my anxiety turns everyday interactions into minefields.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that vulnerability with me—it takes courage to articulate how anxiety shapes your interactions. Could you reflect on what has helped you feel most resilient or capable in managing these challenges, even in small ways?

patient: Honestly, the little moments where I feel seen for who I am, not my height, help me hang on. Like last week, I went hiking with a friend who didn’t once comment on my stature—we just laughed and talked about music. Being in nature also helps, weirdly. When I’m surrounded by tall trees or mountains, it’s like the world reminds me there are bigger things than my insecurities. It’s still a struggle, but those pockets of feeling 'enough' as I am... they give me hope I can build on.

interviewer: It’s beautiful how those moments in nature and with supportive friends become anchors for you. I want to gently explore if there have been other challenging experiences or adversities in your life—whether related to your height or otherwise—that might be shaping these patterns of self-doubt or anxiety?

patient: I think about how my parents handled things growing up… My dad was really tall and proud of it, but he’d sometimes make jokes like, ‘You’ll have to aim lower in relationships, sweetheart’ when I was a teen. It wasn’t mean, but those comments felt… like they were normalizing the idea that my height was a problem. And in high school, a boy I liked once said, ‘You’re cute, but dating a giant might scare off my friends.’ That stuck with me more than I realized until now. I guess I’ve been carrying that ‘giant’ label as a flaw, even though I know logically it’s nonsense. It’s just hard to shake when it feels like part of your identity.

interviewer: Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life, either on purpose or by accident?

patient: No, I haven’t had thoughts of harming myself intentionally. But... sometimes the loneliness feels so heavy, like I’m stuck in this loop of fearing rejection and pushing people away. It’s exhausting.

interviewer: I hear how isolating that can feel, Laura. To better understand your current state, have you ever experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, perhaps engaging in more risks than usual?

patient: No, I don't think so. Most of the time, my energy feels low, especially when anxiety is high. I remember once staying up late to finish a project because I was stressed, but that was more out of anxiety than feeling energetic or excited. I don’t recall feeling like I could do more without sleep or take risks.

interviewer: It sounds like the loneliness and fear of rejection can feel really heavy to carry. Let’s continue exploring some other aspects of your experience. Have you ever noticed any hallucinations, delusions, or persistent paranoid thoughts where you feel others are judging or targeting you in a specific way?

patient: No, I haven't experienced hallucinations or delusions. The most intense part is the constant worry that people are judging my height, but it's more like a deep-seated self-consciousness rather than believing others are actively targeting me. I sometimes overanalyze interactions, wondering if someone's comment or glance was about my height, but it's not like I hear voices or see things that aren't there.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying that. Let’s move on to another important area. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances in the past month, and if so, how often? This helps me understand any factors that might be influencing your anxiety or coping patterns.

patient: No, I haven’t used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances in the past month. I’ve been focusing on positive self-talk and distractions like walking or reading to manage my anxiety, though it’s not always enough.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness in sharing how you've been managing anxiety through positive self-talk and distractions. To ensure I have a complete picture, could you tell me if you're currently taking any medications or supplements, including things like antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, or herbal remedies?

patient: I'm not currently taking any medications or supplements for anxiety or depression. I tried an herbal remedy like valerian root a few years ago, but it didn't help much. I've mainly relied on self-talk and distraction so far.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like your journey has involved navigating deep-seated insecurities about your height, shaped by past rejections and self-critical patterns, which have led to social withdrawal and strained relationships. Let’s recap: We’ve explored how early experiences and avoidance behaviors may be maintaining these struggles, while your resilience and coping strategies are strengths. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I appreciate the summary—it captures the core of what I’ve shared. One thing you didn’t mention is how my dad’s teasing about my height growing up still feels present, like a shadow I carry. Also, while I’ve avoided dating to protect myself, I haven’t fully addressed how this withdrawal affects my existing friendships—I push people away even when I crave connection. Oh, and the hiking example… those moments of feeling ‘enough’ are real but fleeting, which I guess shows there’s still a part of me waiting for validation.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those layers—it’s clear how your father’s comments and the push-pull with relationships shape your experience. To frame this, let’s explore a tentative model: Your childhood teasing may have laid a foundation of self-doubt (predisposing), which intensified after rejections in your 20s (precipitating). Now, avoiding dating and withdrawing from friends might be keeping these fears alive (perpetuating), while moments like hiking or supportive friendships act as protective factors. Does this model align with your experience, or is there something I’ve overlooked?

patient: Yes, that model feels accurate. The childhood teasing and rejections definitely set the foundation, and avoiding dating to 'protect' myself does keep me stuck. I hadn’t framed the hiking/friendship moments as protective factors, but they *do* remind me I can feel ‘enough’—even if it’s fleeting. Maybe societal standards about women’s height also play a role? I notice it in media or casual comments, which silently reinforces the idea that my height is a ‘problem’ to fix.

interviewer: Thank you for adding those important layers—your father’s influence and the push-pull with friendships deepen our understanding. To move forward, what would you like to prioritize next in our work together? For example, exploring strategies to address avoidance patterns, challenging societal standards, or building resilience in relationships?

patient: I’d like to focus on breaking the cycle of avoidance and learning to engage in relationships without bracing for rejection. For example, I want to explore how to talk openly about my height insecurities without feeling exposed, or to recognize when someone isn’t judging me at all—like that hike with my friend where it didn’t come up. Also, unpacking how my dad’s teasing and past rejections still show up in my mind when I meet new people would help. I think working on those two things could make me feel less stuck in fear.

interviewer: Thank you for the thoughtful clarity—it’s powerful how you’re connecting past experiences with current patterns while also noticing moments of resilience. To finalize our next steps, would exploring cognitive-behavioral strategies (like graded exposure to social situations or challenging self-critical thoughts about height) align with your goals, or is there another approach you’d prefer? Also, is there anything else we haven’t covered that feels important to address?

patient: I’m open to trying CBT strategies, especially since the idea of graded exposure feels manageable if we build it slowly—like starting with low-pressure interactions where I can practice not bracing for judgment. Challenging my self-critical thoughts might help too, but I’m also wondering if we could incorporate more work on self-compassion, since I’ve noticed those fleeting moments of feeling ‘enough’ (like hiking with my friend) are tied to self-acceptance. As for other things, I think exploring how my dad’s teasing and the high school comment still haunt me would be important. I’m not sure how to untangle that kind of internalized shame from my adult self-view, even when I logically know those people didn’t ‘define’ me.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Reports anxiety related to height impacting social confidence since early 20s, escalating after romantic rejections. Avoids dating to 'protect' self, leading to loneliness. Self-conscious in interactions (e.g., crossed arms, slouched posture). Notable quote: 'I can’t meet someone new without my brain instantly bracing for judgment.'

Objective: Avoidance of dating/social situations; guarded in friendships. No suicidal ideation or hallucinations. No substance use in past month. Prior herbal remedy (valerian root) ineffective. Low energy, high anxiety in social contexts.

Assessment: Anxiety perpetuated by childhood teasing (father’s comments normalizing height as 'problem'), precipitated by 20s rejections. Avoidance maintains fear cycle. Protective factors: moments of self-acceptance (e.g., hiking with supportive friends). Societal standards on women’s height may reinforce internalized shame.

Plan: CBT strategies: graded exposure to social interactions, challenging self-critical thoughts, self-compassion exercises. Address internalized shame from childhood/father’s comments. Monitor avoidance patterns and build resilience through low-pressure social practice. Explore societal influences on self-view.
