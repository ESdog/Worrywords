interviewer: Hello Tyler, I'm Dr. Michael Freeman. Would you be comfortable proceeding with our session today?

patient: Yes, I'm comfortable proceeding. The stress of my boyfriend being overseas and the uncertainty about our future is really getting to me, but I want to figure this out.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Tyler. It sounds like this uncertainty is really weighing on you. Before we dive in, would you like a brief explanation of how these sessions typically work or any questions about the process?

patient: No, that’s okay. I think I understand the basics already. But maybe I could ask… how exactly does counseling help with anxiety like mine? I’ve never done this before, so I’m a little unsure what to expect.

interviewer: Thank you for your thoughtful question, Tyler. Do you have any additional questions about the purpose or structure of our counseling sessions before we begin?

patient: No, I think we can start. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm ready to work on this.

interviewer: It sounds like the uncertainty about your relationship is really taking a toll on your daily life. What are you hoping to achieve through counseling?

patient: I guess I want to learn how to manage the anxiety better... like, not feel so consumed by these worries every day. It’s hard to focus on anything else when my mind keeps spiraling about what could go wrong with us. I also want to figure out if there’s a way to have more clarity about our future without driving myself crazy trying to plan for it. My mom’s here but I can’t really talk to her about this, so maybe counseling could help me feel less alone in this mess.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like the uncertainty about your relationship is really weighing on you. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety or stress in the past?

patient: No, this is the first time I’ve experienced anxiety like this. It’s different from any stress I’ve felt before, especially since it’s about the future of my relationship and feels so constant.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about this being new for you. Can you tell me about other people in your life who you feel comfortable talking to about your worries, or who provide support during stressful times?

patient: Honestly, there’s not many people I feel close enough to talk about this with. My mom’s my main family here, but she doesn’t really get how serious this is—she says ‘all relationships have challenges’ and it feels like she’s brushing it off. I tried messaging a couple of friends from before, but I guess we’ve drifted, and I don’t want to burden anyone with my stuff. It’s just… been pretty isolating, which is why I’m here, I guess. The constant second-guessing eats at me, and I can’t even have someone to vent to without feeling like I’m overreacting.

interviewer: It sounds like feeling isolated without close support is really compounding your stress. Can you share a bit about what helps you cope when the anxiety feels overwhelming, or any strategies that have brought you some relief, even small ones?

patient: I try to play video games or work extra hours to keep my mind off it, but it doesn’t really help. The worry always comes back, especially at night when I’m trying to sleep. Sometimes I’ll message my boyfriend just to hear his voice, but that’s hard with the time difference.

interviewer: It sounds like reaching out to your boyfriend provides some comfort despite the challenges. Have there been any other difficult experiences or challenges in your past that you think might be related to how you're feeling now?

patient: Honestly, this is the first time I’ve dealt with something like this. I’ve never had to handle a relationship with so much uncertainty before—it’s all new territory. The only other time I felt overwhelmed like this was when I first moved out on my own, but that was more about adapting to independence than relationship stress. I guess I just never learned how to handle situations where I can’t control the outcome.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: I want to check in on your safety. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts about harming myself, but I do feel overwhelmed by the stress a lot. It's been hard to sleep sometimes because my mind won't stop worrying about everything.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns recently, such as feeling more energetic than usual or needing less sleep, even if it's different from your typical routine?

patient: I’ve been having trouble sleeping—sometimes lying awake at night worrying, or waking up in the middle of the night with my mind racing. It’s left me more tired than usual, even if I do manage to fall asleep eventually. I haven’t noticed any changes in energy levels besides feeling drained from the lack of rest.

interviewer: I’m sorry to hear that the lack of rest is affecting you so much. Have you ever experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed significantly less sleep than usual, even if it felt different from your typical routine?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced that. My sleep issues are more about lying awake at night worrying about everything, not feeling energetic or unable to sleep because of restlessness like that.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently?

patient: No, I haven't. My worries feel intense but they're all about the real-life challenges with my boyfriend's situation. I don't have any thoughts that feel detached from reality or paranoid - the anxiety is focused on the actual logistics and uncertainty of our relationship.

interviewer: I appreciate your clarity. Let’s discuss coping strategies briefly—have you used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances to manage your stress or anxiety related to your relationship concerns?

patient: No, I haven’t used any substances like that. I’ve tried to avoid them because I don’t want to make things worse, especially since my mom would probably disapprove. I just… get stuck trying to think through everything on my own, even when it’s not working.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about avoiding substances. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies—prescription, over-the-counter, or things you take for stress or sleep?

patient: No, I’m not taking any medications or supplements right now. I’ve never needed anything for sleep or anxiety before, and honestly, I didn’t know where to start with that. I guess I’ve just been relying on distractions like games or work, but they don’t really help much.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Let me briefly recap: Your main concerns are ongoing anxiety and sleep disruption due to uncertainty about your long-distance relationship, which started when your boyfriend moved overseas. Predisposing factors include a recent adjustment to independent living; the precipitating event was his move; perpetuating factors are rumination, lack of familial support, and time-zone barriers; protective factors include your proactive engagement in counseling and maintaining communication with your boyfriend. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You hit most of the key points, but maybe missed how my coping strategies—like gaming or work—actually don’t help much, they just keep me busy. Also, even though I message him often, the time difference means I’m left overanalyzing every word, which loops me back into worrying. Oh, and I guess the isolation part? My old friends don’t get it, and I don’t want to make my mom worry, so I’ve just been carrying it alone.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying those points, Tyler. Let me adjust my summary accordingly: Your anxiety is fueled by coping strategies like gaming and work that only keep you busy, not resolve the worry. The time difference with your boyfriend leads to overanalyzing messages, and you feel isolated without a supportive network. What else might I have missed or misunderstood here?

patient: I think you got the main points, but maybe the part about how I can’t talk to my mom or old friends adds to the isolation more than I realized. Also, the anxiety feels different from past stress because there’s no clear way to ‘fix’ this—it’s like being stuck in a loop of worrying without any control over the outcome, even when I try to focus on other things.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how the isolation and lack of control amplify the anxiety—it’s clear this is taking a toll on your emotional and physical well-being. Is there anything else I’ve missed or misunderstood about your experience?

patient: Thank you—I think you’ve captured the core of it. The time difference complicates even simple things like messaging him, and I end up overanalyzing every conversation. Sometimes I second-guess if my worries are ‘too much,’ but they feel unavoidable. Also, my mom’s dismissive like, ‘Just visit him already!’ makes me feel like my stress isn’t valid. It’s hard to explain how the uncertainty gnaws at me constantly, even when I’m trying to focus on work or games. I guess I’m just… tired of feeling like I’m stuck in this loop with no way to break it.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing so openly, Tyler. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of emotional weight without a strong support system, which must be exhausting. Let’s briefly recap: We’ve identified your anxiety as stemming from relationship uncertainty, worsened by time-zone barriers, ineffective coping strategies, and isolation. Your mom’s dismissiveness adds to the stress, and you’re tired of feeling stuck in this cycle. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You hit most of the key points, but maybe missed that the anxiety specifically started when he moved to Italy a few months ago. Also, I mentioned trying to distract myself with video games and other activities, but they don’t really work. Oh, and even though messaging him helps a little, I still end up overthinking everything.

interviewer: Thank you for the additional clarity, Tyler. To synthesize: Your anxiety began with your boyfriend’s move to Italy, worsened by ineffective distractions and overanalysis of communication. The isolation from unsupportive family and distant friends amplifies the stress, while your mom’s dismissiveness invalidates your concerns. Let’s confirm the formulation: Predisposing factors include your recent transition to independent living; precipitating event was the move; perpetuating factors are rumination, time-zone barriers, and lack of validation; protective factors are your proactive counseling engagement and relationship communication. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: That’s a solid summary, but I still live with my mom, so the 'independent living transition' part doesn’t quite fit. I think my tendency to overthink and need control might be a bigger predisposing factor. Other than that, you got the main points right—the move triggered it, the time difference and rumination keep it going, and trying to reach out to him and coming here are the positives.

interviewer: Thank you for the clarifications, Tyler. To confirm, we’ve adjusted the formulation to reflect that your predisposing factors include a tendency to overthink and seek control, rather than independent living. The precipitating event was your boyfriend’s move to Italy, perpetuated by time-zone stress, rumination, and isolation. Protective factors include your proactive counseling engagement and relationship communication. Now, let’s plan next steps: Would you like to prioritize developing coping strategies for rumination, exploring therapy approaches (like CBT or mindfulness), or setting specific goals for managing relationship uncertainty? Also, is there anything else we haven’t covered that feels important to address?

patient: Thanks for outlining that. I think working on coping strategies for the constant worrying would help me start regaining control. The rumination keeps me stuck in cycles, especially at night—so learning to disrupt that would make daily life feel less overwhelming. I’m also curious about CBT, since my thoughts about the relationship often spiral into catastrophizing. If possible, I’d like to set a goal for building healthier communication with my boyfriend without over-analyzing every message. I don’t think there’s anything major missing—those feel like the core issues for now.

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve identified a clear path forward with coping strategies, CBT exploration, and communication goals. Before we finalize this plan, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust about our discussion today?

patient: The plan sounds good, but maybe we could focus on practical steps for managing the time difference when communicating with my boyfriend—it’s a big hurdle. Also, I’d like to work on sleep strategies, since the anxiety keeps me up most nights. That’s about it, though.

system: --- Phase 5 End ---

system: --- Session Summary ---

Subjective: Patient reports anxiety and sleep disruption due to boyfriend's overseas deployment, with symptoms worsening over months. Describes constant worry about relationship future, rumination at night, and feeling 'stuck in a loop' of stress. Sleep issues include difficulty falling/asleep and racing thoughts, leading to fatigue. Notes isolation due to unsupportive family (mother dismissive of concerns) and distant friends. No prior anxiety episodes; current stress differs from past challenges (e.g., moving out). Patient avoids substances, denies suicidal ideation but feels 'exhausted' by emotional burden.

Objective: Engaged in session, articulate about stressors, and identifies coping attempts (gaming, work) as ineffective. Time-zone barriers and message overanalysis noted as perpetuating anxiety. Acknowledges proactive counseling engagement and maintains boyfriend communication as protective factors.

Assessment: Anxiety linked to relationship uncertainty, exacerbated by time-zone stress, rumination, and lack of social validation. Predisposing factors: perfectionism/control-seeking tendencies; precipitating event: boyfriend's move to Italy. Perpetuating factors: ineffective coping, isolation, and invalidating family dynamics. No acute safety concerns but significant functional impairment (sleep, focus).

Plan: Prioritize CBT-based coping strategies for rumination and sleep hygiene. Explore communication techniques to reduce message overanalysis. Set goal: develop practical tools for time-zone relationship management. Monitor anxiety progression and consider sleep-focused interventions if impairment persists.
