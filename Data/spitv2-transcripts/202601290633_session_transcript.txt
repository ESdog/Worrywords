interviewer: Mr. Keith, before we begin, would you like to share your preferred name or pronouns?

patient: My name is Richard Keith, and I go by he/him pronouns.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Richard. Do you have any questions about the purpose of our sessions or how they'll be structured before we begin?

patient: No, I think you explained the general idea already. But I’m curious—will we be working specifically on managing these anxious thoughts about the federal court job, or will it be more… general? I just want to make sure these sessions are practical for what I’m dealing with.

interviewer: It's good to hear you're interested in practical strategies for your transition. Would you be comfortable moving forward with our sessions to address these specific concerns about your federal court job?

patient: Yes, I'd like to proceed. It's challenging to talk about, but I need help managing these thoughts before starting the job—this anxiety is disrupting my routine even though the position hasn't begun yet.

interviewer: It sounds like the anticipation of this job transition is creating a lot of stress for you, even before it's started. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first started feeling these concerns about the federal court position?

patient: The concerns really began taking shape about three months ago, when I started preparing for the transition. I kept comparing the federal court’s procedures and culture to my current role here in the Circuit Court, and it became clear how different things would be. Even though I’ve spent decades in judiciary work, the idea of starting over in an environment where I don’t know anyone—combined with the fear of not measuring up to federal standards—has been gnawing at me. It’s not just the work itself; it’s the social aspect too. I worry I’ll struggle to build the relationships I need to function effectively.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Judge Keith. It takes courage to discuss these challenges. How has this anxiety been affecting your daily routine—have you noticed changes in your sleep, concentration, or energy levels since these concerns began?

patient: My sleep has been disrupted—I often lie awake at night worrying about the transition, and I wake up feeling more tired than when I went to bed. My concentration has slipped too; I’ve caught myself distracted during routine tasks, like missing steps in my morning routine or forgetting details in conversations. The energy I usually have for my current work feels drained, even when I’m not physically exerting myself. It’s as if my mind is running on overdrive, leaving little room for rest.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Judge Keith. It’s understandable how such a significant transition could feel overwhelming. Can you tell me what strategies you’ve used so far to manage these anxious thoughts, and whether they’ve helped, made things harder, or felt neutral?

patient: I’ve mostly tried telling myself that my experience as a judge should qualify me, so I should be fine. It helps a little, but the doubt still lingers. Sometimes I avoid thinking about it too much, but that just makes the anxiety worse when I can’t push it away.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing your coping strategies, Judge Keith. It’s clear you’re proactive about addressing these challenges. As we move forward, what would you most hope to achieve through our work together in the next few weeks or months?

patient: I hope to develop practical strategies to manage my anxiety and build confidence in the new federal court environment. I want to address the root of my fear—feeling like an outsider without established connections—and create a mental framework that allows me to focus on my work rather than these doubts. Ideally, I’d like to start this transition with a sense of preparedness instead of dread.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It's commendable that you're being proactive about addressing these concerns. Have you experienced any significant stressful or traumatic events in your life that might be contributing to these feelings of anxiety about the new job?

patient: No, I haven't experienced any major stressful or traumatic events in my life that I can recall. This anxiety feels distinct—tied specifically to the unfamiliarity of federal court protocols and the pressure to adapt quickly. I’ve managed high-stakes situations before, but this transition feels different because the foundation of trust and camaraderie in federal settings isn’t something I can simply transfer from my previous role.

interviewer: It sounds like your colleagues are an important part of your support system. Can you share how you typically rely on them during professional transitions, and whether you feel comfortable reaching out to them for support as you navigate this new role?

patient: I usually rely on colleagues for practical advice during transitions, like when I shifted from county court to circuit court. We’d discuss protocols, expectations, and even shared stories to ease the adjustment. But this federal court role feels different—so many new systems, people, and standards. I haven’t shared my doubts yet because I fear it might make me seem... inadequate. Last week, I asked a federal court friend about their onboarding, but they gave vague answers, which only made me more nervous. I keep thinking, ‘What if I ask the wrong question and look unprepared?’ Still, I might reach out again if the anxiety doesn’t subside. Do you think that’s a good idea?

interviewer: It’s understandable to feel hesitant about reaching out when the stakes feel so high. You mentioned being proactive about seeking strategies—what personal values or strengths do you think have helped you navigate past professional challenges, and how might those apply here?

patient: Well, throughout my career, I’ve always relied on preparation and integrity. In the Circuit Court, I made it a point to thoroughly understand cases and build rapport with colleagues over time. While federal procedures are different, my ability to adapt to complex systems—like when I first became a judge—gives me some confidence. I just need to remind myself that competence isn’t about knowing *everyone* upfront, but about showing up prepared, which I’ve always done. Though… easier said than done when anxiety clouds that perspective.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Let's talk about your health habits. Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances since these feelings about the new job began?

patient: No, I haven't changed my use of alcohol or other substances. I don’t use cannabis, and my alcohol consumption has stayed the same—maybe a glass of wine occasionally. But the stress has affected my sleep more than my habits.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Judge Keith. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts about harming myself. My focus has been on managing the anxiety through counseling and preparing for the transition. I’m determined to work through this before the job starts.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Judge Keith. Have you noticed any periods in the last few months where you felt unusually energetic, needed significantly less sleep, or acted more impulsively than usual—like taking risks you wouldn’t normally take?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced any unusual energy or impulsivity lately. My sleep issues are more about restlessness than feeling energized—I just can’t stop thinking about the job transition. I’ve actually felt mentally drained, not the opposite.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying that, Judge Keith. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently—such as hearing voices, believing others are monitoring you, or feeling excessively suspicious about people’s intentions?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced hallucinations or delusions. The suspicion I feel is more about my own doubts in unfamiliar environments, not about others’ intentions. For example, when my federal court friend gave vague answers earlier, I worried I was missing something obvious, but that’s more anxiety-driven than paranoia.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying that, Judge Keith. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or over-the-counter drugs—either for physical health, sleep, or anything else?

patient: No, I’m not on any prescribed medications or supplements at the moment. I’ve tried over-the-counter sleep aids occasionally, but they don’t really help, and I’m not sure if they’re worth continuing with.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: To ensure we’re aligned, here’s a brief recap: Your anxiety stems from transitioning to a federal court role, fueled by unfamiliar protocols, fear of underperformance, and social isolation concerns. This has disrupted your sleep and daily routine, though you’re proactively seeking strategies. Protective factors include your judicial experience and adaptability. What did I miss or need to adjust?

patient: You’ve captured the core accurately. I’d add the specific comparison between federal and Circuit Court procedures—federal’s stricter protocols feel alien, and the lack of existing relationships there amplifies my unease. Also, my hesitation to ask colleagues for help (even my federal contact gave vague answers), fearing it might signal unpreparedness. Lastly, these feelings have been building for three months, not just recent. Otherwise, your summary aligns with my experience.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those details—they add important nuance to our understanding. Here’s a tentative formulation: Your anxiety likely stems from predisposing factors (longstanding concerns about judgment and past transitions), precipitated by the new federal role’s unfamiliarity. Perpetuating factors include avoidance of seeking help and rumination about protocol differences. Protective factors include your adaptability, prior judicial success, and proactive preparation. What did I miss or need to adjust before we move forward?

patient: Your formulation captures the core of it. I’d add that my fear of appearing unprepared in front of peers is sharper than past transitions—before, I had trusted colleagues to lean on, but federal systems feel insular. Also, while I acknowledge my preparation skills, the anxiety warps my self-trust. For example, I’ll review protocols repeatedly, yet still imagine flubbing a federal hearing. I’m not avoiding the job itself, but the emotional weight of needing to rebuild credibility in an environment where I lack mentors. Lastly, the sleep disruption is compounding the stress—restless nights mean mornings feel more daunting. I don’t want to overlook how physical effects feed the mental loop.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those important nuances—it’s clear how the lack of established support systems and sleep disruption are intensifying your anxiety. To conclude this phase, what steps would you like to prioritize moving forward (e.g., developing federal court-specific coping strategies, addressing sleep patterns, or building professional connections), and is there anything else we haven’t covered that’s important to you?

patient: I’d like to prioritize developing federal court-specific coping strategies first, since the unfamiliar procedures and cultural differences feel like the root of my anxiety. Next, addressing my sleep patterns would help—restless nights make the doubts feel heavier. I’d also like guidance on how to build professional connections without appearing unprepared, maybe through gradual outreach or structured preparation. Lastly, reinforcing my confidence in applying my experience to this new context would be valuable. I don’t think we’ve discussed practical steps for reframing self-doubt when it arises, so that might be worth exploring.
