interviewer: Hayden, to start, could you share your preferred name and pronouns if you're comfortable?

patient: My name is Hayden, and I use she/her pronouns.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Hayden. Do you have any questions about how this session will go or what we might discuss today?

patient: No, I don’t have specific questions, but I’m open to discussing what’s needed to help. I just hope we can figure out why these doubts keep coming up even when I try to push through.

interviewer: It makes sense that persistent doubts can feel overwhelming, especially when you're trying to push through. Would you be comfortable continuing with our conversation today?

patient: Yeah, I guess so... I mean, it’s kind of hard to talk about this stuff, but I wanted to get better. I just hope we can figure out why I can’t even enjoy gaming anymore.

interviewer: Thank you for your courage in sharing this, Hayden. Just to confirm, are you comfortable proceeding with our discussion today?

patient: Yes, I'm okay with moving forward. It's a bit uncomfortable talking about this, but I want to work through it.

interviewer: It makes sense to want to address these challenges. Just to confirm, you understand this session will involve exploring your experiences with gaming-related doubts and discussing how we might work together, correct?

patient: Yeah, that sounds right. I guess I just want to figure out why I can’t shake these feelings about Fortnite. It’s starting to make me question other things too, like if I’m just... not good at sticking with anything.

interviewer: It takes courage to share these thoughts, Hayden. Is there anything specific you'd like to clarify or ask about before we move forward today?

patient: Thanks... I think I just wanted to make sure this is a safe space where I can talk without judgment. To be honest, I’m nervous, but I’m ready to work on this. I guess I’m wondering if we’ll also touch on how these feelings affect my confidence beyond Fortnite?

system: --- Phase 1 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It’s encouraging to hear you’re motivated to work through this. What would you most hope to achieve through counseling, Hayden?

patient: Honestly, I guess I want to figure out how to stop letting these feelings ruin my confidence—not just in gaming but in other areas too. I’d also hope to find a way to play Fortnite without dreading it or feeling like I’m going to fail before I even start. It’s just… frustrating to let something like this take up so much space in my head when I know I should be able to just enjoy it.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that—it takes courage to acknowledge how something is affecting so many areas. Can you tell me a bit more about when these feelings first started and how they’ve changed over time?

patient: I guess it started a few months ago when I just… couldn’t get better at Fortnite no matter how much I practiced. My friends kept talking about their progress, and I felt like I was falling behind. At first, it was frustrating, but now it’s worse—I don’t even want to play anymore because I’m scared I’ll just fail again. The doubts used to only pop up when I was playing, but now they follow me even when I’m thinking about it casually, like when people mention it. I tried breaking it into smaller goals, like just surviving one round, but I still end up putting the game down and not trying again.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been really draining, Hayden—thank you for sharing so openly. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels since these feelings started?

patient: Yeah, I’ve been feeling more anxious and drained lately, especially when I think about gaming or see others play. It’s like my energy dips whenever I encounter Fortnite-related stuff, even if I’m just scrolling through social media.

interviewer: It’s understandable how that energy drain could feel overwhelming. You mentioned trying to set small goals in the game—have there been other strategies you’ve used to cope with these feelings, either ones that helped or maybe made things feel harder?

patient: Honestly, I tried taking breaks from gaming to reset my mind, but that just made me feel like I was avoiding the problem. I also used to watch my friends play Fortnite to learn from them, but it ended up making me feel even more inadequate. Those moments would leave me frustrated, like I was stuck in this loop of wanting to get better but not knowing how to start without failing again.

interviewer: It sounds like the frustration of feeling stuck is really weighing on you—thank you for sharing that vulnerability. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or concentration since these feelings started, even if small?

patient: I haven't noticed major changes in my sleep or concentration, but sometimes I'll lie awake thinking about how I 'should' be better at Fortnite or catch myself zoning out during other games because my mind keeps circling back to it. It's not constant, though—I can still focus on schoolwork when I need to.

system: --- Phase 2 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: It sounds like your friends are a source of support even if you haven’t shared these specific feelings with them yet. Can you tell me about any other experiences in your life—academic, social, or otherwise—that might have shaped how you view challenges or setbacks, either positively or negatively?

patient: Honestly, I’ve never struggled like this before—I’ve always been able to work through challenges, especially in school. But with Fortnite, it’s different. I guess it’s frustrating because I compare myself to friends who just *get* it, making me feel like there’s something wrong with me specifically. I don’t want to give up, but it’s like my brain keeps hitting a wall it can’t climb. That fear of failure feels… louder here than anywhere else, even though I handle stress okay in other areas.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to keep up with friends and the fear of failure in Fortnite are really weighing on you. Have you experienced any past situations or challenges that might be contributing to these feelings of self-doubt or anxiety?

patient: I don't think so... At least, not in my memory. But maybe I’ve always been a bit of a perfectionist in small ways. Like, in middle school I would stress over grades even when I was doing fine. But with Fortnite, it’s different—there’s this constant comparison to friends who seem to pick it up faster. I guess I just fear... that if I can’t master it, I’m somehow not ‘trying hard enough’?

interviewer: It’s thoughtful of you to reflect on how past experiences shape current challenges. Can you tell me a bit about your family environment during middle school? Were there any expectations or dynamics that might have contributed to that perfectionist mindset?

patient: My family environment during middle school was... pretty standard, I guess? My parents were supportive but definitely had high expectations, especially academically. I remember feeling like I had to be ‘on’ all the time, like if I didn’t get straight A’s or excel in extracurriculars, I’d let them down. There wasn’t any direct pressure about gaming—it wasn’t really a thing back then—but I think I internalized the idea that not being perfect meant I was failing. Like, even if I did well, I’d obsess over the one grade that wasn’t a 100%. Maybe that’s why video games feel so... loaded now? I guess I’ve always been my own worst critic.

interviewer: It’s thoughtful of you to reflect on how past experiences shape current challenges. Can you tell me a bit about your family environment during middle school? Were there any expectations or dynamics that might have contributed to that perfectionist mindset?

patient: My parents were pretty supportive overall, but I think they emphasized doing your best in everything. My mom would get upset if I didn’t finish school projects perfectly, even if I said I was ‘close enough.’ There was this constant push to be the best in class, which... I guess carried over into how I approach things now. Like, if I can’t master something quickly, I start thinking there’s something wrong with me. It wasn’t loud or harsh, but the pressure to avoid mistakes stuck with me. Fortnite just became this new arena where that old fear showed up again, maybe?

interviewer: It’s thoughtful of you to reflect on how past experiences shape current challenges. Can you tell me about any other experiences in your life, such as difficult or challenging situations, that you think might be connected to how you're feeling about Fortnite or your confidence in general?

patient: Honestly, I don’t think I’ve dealt with anything like this before. I’ve had to work hard for things—like passing tough classes or learning new games—where I struggled at first but eventually improved. But with Fortnite, it’s different. Even when I practice, I feel like I’m not getting better, and it makes me question if I’m just... bad at sticking with things. It’s weird because I used to be proud of my persistence, but now I’m scared to even try, thinking I’ll just fail again.

system: --- Phase 3 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently? If so, can you tell me about the frequency, any plans or means you might have considered, and how you feel about following through?

patient: No, I haven’t had thoughts of harming myself or ending my life. My frustration is more about feeling stuck in this cycle of self-doubt with Fortnite, not about wanting to hurt myself. I’m trying to work through it here, but the stress is definitely frustrating.

interviewer: I'm glad to hear you're not experiencing thoughts of self-harm. Let's talk about your energy levels. Have you noticed any recent changes in your sleep patterns, energy levels, or a sense of restlessness or overactivity that might interfere with your daily life?

patient: My sleep has been a bit off lately. I’ll lie awake thinking about how I should be better at Fortnite, which makes it hard to fall asleep sometimes. It’s not constant, but those nights feel exhausting. I don’t notice huge changes in my energy during the day, but I get this restless feeling when I’m around the game—like my brain is racing even if I’m just scrolling through a forum post about it. It’s not stopping me from doing schoolwork or stuff, but it’s definitely wearing on me.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like the game-related stress is really impacting your rest. Let's shift focus slightly—have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or restless to the point of not needing much sleep, or taken risks you wouldn’t normally take (like spending sprees, impulsive decisions, or rapid speech)?

patient: No, I don’t think so. I’ve actually been on the opposite end—struggling with restlessness tied to stress about Fortnite, but it’s more like my mind won’t shut off rather than feeling overly energetic. I tend to get drained quickly, especially when thinking about the game, so the idea of not needing sleep doesn’t really fit.

interviewer: Thank you for explaining how the stress affects your rest—it’s valid to feel worn down by persistent worries. Moving forward, have you used any substances like alcohol, cannabis, or others to cope with stress or improve your sleep? If so, how often and in what amounts?

patient: No, I haven’t used any substances like alcohol or cannabis to cope. I’ve tried to avoid that because I don’t want to add more things to feel bad about, especially since schoolwork still needs focus. Sometimes I’ll just stare at the ceiling for hours trying to quiet my mind, but… it’s not helping much.

interviewer: It’s commendable that you’ve avoided substances while managing this stress. Let’s continue assessing your well-being—have you experienced any hallucinations (seeing/hearing things others don’t), strong beliefs that seem unusual or unfounded, or thoughts that others are trying to harm you or spy on you?

patient: No, I haven’t experienced hallucinations or thoughts like that. But sometimes when I get really stressed about Fortnite, I’ll feel overwhelmed or anxious in a way that makes my mind race—like, what if I’m just not cut out for this?—but it’s more about self-doubt than anything unusual or paranoid.

interviewer: It’s clear you’ve been managing stress without turning to substances, which shows strength. Let’s briefly check on medications—have you been prescribed any medications or taken supplements (including vitamins, herbal remedies, etc.) recently? If so, could you share what they are and how you’re using them?

patient: No, I haven’t been prescribed any medications or taken supplements recently. I’ve mostly tried self-help strategies like setting small goals or taking breaks, but nothing medical.

system: --- Phase 4 End ---

system: ---

interviewer: What I’ve gathered so far is that your struggles with Fortnite have sparked a cycle of self-doubt, fueled by perfectionist tendencies rooted in past academic pressures. This has led to avoidance, frustration, and a dip in confidence that’s spilling into other areas. We’ve also noted your strengths—like proactive coping and a supportive network—as key tools for moving forward. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re mostly right, but I’d add that my sleep’s been affected too—lying awake worrying about the game, even when I’m not actively playing. Also, while schoolwork hasn’t slipped, I get restless and mentally ‘racing’ when thinking about Fortnite, even just seeing it in forums. The small goals and breaks I tried helped a little but didn’t really break the cycle. Oh, and the comparisons with friends are still a big trigger, even if my actual relationships haven’t crumbled.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing those details—sleep disturbances and mental restlessness are important pieces we’ll address. Let me outline a brief model: Your perfectionism (predisposing) and past academic pressures likely set the stage for self-criticism. The recent plateau in Fortnite (precipitating) triggered fears of failure, which now perpetuate through avoidance and social comparisons. Protective factors include your proactive coping and supportive relationships. Does this align with your experience, or is something missing?

patient: That definitely fits what I’ve been feeling—like the perfectionism from my family and school is part of why this feels so personal. I guess I’d add that comparing myself to friends who are good at Fortnite makes the fear of failure feel even louder. It’s like their success highlights my ‘lack of progress’ more, even if we all play for fun. The model makes sense, but maybe the social comparisons are a bigger part of why I’m stuck?

interviewer: What would you like to focus on next in our sessions?

patient: I’d like to understand why Fortnite feels so tied to my self-worth, even though I know it’s just a game. I’m curious if the pressure to be ‘good enough’ from middle school somehow makes this different from other challenges I’ve handled. Also, I want to figure out how to break the cycle where fear of failure makes me avoid it entirely, which just makes me feel worse. Maybe we can work on rebuilding confidence without comparing myself to others?

interviewer: Thank you for sharing your thoughtful priorities. To confirm, our next steps would involve exploring how past perfectionism intersects with your current self-worth, developing strategies to interrupt the avoidance cycle, and building confidence through non-comparative goals. Is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust about this plan?

patient: That sounds like a solid plan. I think focusing on the perfectionism and avoidance makes sense, but I also want to work on not comparing myself to others since that really amplifies my anxiety about Fortnite.

interviewer: Thank you for confirming the focus areas. To ensure our plan is complete, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust about our next steps, or any preferences for how we approach these goals (e.g., therapy style, lifestyle strategies)?

patient: I think diving into how my perfectionism around Fortnite connects to other areas of my life would be helpful. Maybe using CBT to untangle the 'I’m not good enough' thoughts when I play. Also, I’d prefer a structured approach where we track small wins without making me feel like I’m failing if I don’t master it overnight.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing your thoughtful priorities. To ensure our plan is complete, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust about our next steps, or any preferences for how we approach these goals (e.g., therapy style, lifestyle strategies)?

patient: I think starting with strategies to challenge my self-doubt when it comes up in Fortnite would be helpful—like, maybe learning to recognize when I’m comparing myself to others and how to reset that mindset. Also, I’d prefer a structured approach, like CBT, since I’m used to setting goals and tracking progress in school. But I’m open to other methods if they’d work better. Oh, and if we could also look at my sleep patterns, since the worrying about the game keeps me awake… that’d probably help break the cycle.

interviewer: I appreciate your detailed input about CBT strategies and sleep patterns—those will be key components. To ensure our plan is comprehensive, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust before we finalize our next steps?

patient: I think it’s important to note how this fear of failure in Fortnite feels tied to my old habits of equating mistakes with personal flaws—like how I’d stress over near-perfect grades before. If we could unpack that connection, it might help me stop letting this game define my self-worth. Also, maybe we could brainstorm ways to separate 'enjoying games' from 'proving I’m good at them'? I miss just playing for fun without the pressure.

interviewer: Thank you for highlighting how past perfectionism shapes your current experience—this connection is crucial for our work. To ensure our plan is complete, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust before we finalize our next steps?

patient: No, I think we’ve covered the core issues. Maybe just to clarify—I want to make sure we don’t overlook how this ties to my fear of being seen as ‘not good enough’ in general. Even though it’s about a game, it feels like a metaphor for bigger insecurities. Also, I should mention that while I avoid Fortnite, I still check leaderboards or friend stats occasionally, which just makes me feel worse. It’s like I can’t even disengage fully. But other than that, I’m ready to focus on strategies to break this cycle.
