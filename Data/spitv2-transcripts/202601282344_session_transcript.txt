interviewer: Hi Wyatt, thank you for coming in today. To start, would you prefer I use a different name or pronouns? I want to make sure I address you correctly.

patient: No, Wyatt is fine. I’m comfortable with that name and pronouns. Thanks for asking.

interviewer: Great, thank you for confirming. Today, we’ll briefly discuss what’s on your mind and how I can support you. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yeah, that sounds good. I’ve been wanting to work on this for a while—especially since it’s starting to mess with my motivation to stay consistent with exercise and preparing for vet school.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing your goals, Wyatt. It makes sense that this anxiety could impact both your workouts and studies. Before we dive in, do you have any questions about how this process works or anything else on your mind?

patient: Not really, no. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I guess I’m just a little nervous to talk about it, but I’m ready to work on figuring this out.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that, Wyatt. It sounds like the gym anxiety has become quite overwhelming. When you feel anxious there, do you notice any other physical or emotional symptoms, like a racing heart, trouble concentrating, or changes in your sleep or appetite?

patient: Yeah, I usually get a really fast heartbeat and my hands get all clammy when I'm there. My mind kind of goes blank sometimes, like I can’t remember how to even do the exercises properly. I think I’ve been waking up tired more often, but I’m not sure if it’s the gym stress or just my sleep schedule messing up.

interviewer: It sounds like the gym anxiety has been building over time. Can you share what specific changes you’ve noticed since it first started a few months ago? For example, how did your experience at the gym differ at the beginning versus now?

patient: At first, I just felt a bit awkward and self-conscious about not knowing the gym etiquette, like putting weights back properly. Now, it’s worse—every time I go, I’m dreading the judgment, even if no one says anything. I’ll rush through my workout or go during off-peak hours to avoid people, but it’s making me less consistent. The anxiety feels constant now, not just occasional.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that progression, Wyatt. It sounds like this has gradually intensified. Have there been any specific events or changes in your life around the time the anxiety started worsening—like a stressful period in your vet school prep, new gym experiences, or shifts in your routine?

patient: The anxiety really started getting worse right after I began my new gym routine a few months ago. At first, I was just nervous about using the equipment properly, but I think my self-consciousness escalated when I overheard someone laugh while I was trying to adjust a weight rack. I haven’t seen any of my usual gym friends since then, so I’ve been avoiding peak hours even though it means my workouts feel rushed. This makes me even more anxious, like I’m confirming everyone’s ‘judging me’ in my head, and it’s hard to stay focused on studying for vet school while all I can think about is the next time I’ll feel this awful at the gym.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness so far, Wyatt. To better understand your experience, have you faced any difficult experiences or challenges in the past that might be connected to feeling self-conscious in social settings like the gym?

patient: Not really, this is actually my first time feeling like this. I mean, I’ve always been a bit self-conscious sometimes, but nothing like the anxiety I get at the gym now. It started with my new routine, and it’s just gotten worse over time.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that this is new for you, Wyatt. I want to make sure I understand all factors that might contribute to this anxiety. Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant challenges in your life that might be connected to feeling self-conscious in social settings like the gym?

patient: Honestly, I don't think there's anything major like that in my past. I mean, I remember being shy in school, but nothing traumatic. The gym anxiety just came out of the blue, really. That time someone laughed at me while I was fumbling with the dumbbells—it just... stuck in my head. Now even when I'm alone at the gym, I feel like people are watching me.

interviewer: Wyatt, have you ever had thoughts of intentionally harming yourself or ending your life? If so, can you share how often these thoughts occur and if you’ve ever made a plan or taken steps to act on them?

patient: No, I haven't had thoughts like that. My anxiety is mostly about the gym and how others perceive me there. I'm worried about not meeting my goals, but it's not about harming myself.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Wyatt. It sounds like the gym environment has become a significant source of stress for you. To better understand your current state, have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or energy levels lately? For example, have you been feeling more energized or less in need of sleep than usual, even if it’s affecting your daily life?

patient: Yeah, my sleep’s been off. I lie awake a lot, my mind racing about the gym, and when I do sleep, I wake up exhausted. It’s like I’m tired even after resting, which makes it harder to focus on my vet school prep.

interviewer: It sounds like your sleep disturbances are adding to the stress you're already managing. Let's briefly check for other patterns—have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic, or need very little sleep, or take on more tasks than usual, even if it’s disruptive?

patient: No, I haven’t noticed anything like that. Most nights I just feel exhausted, even after skipping the gym. My energy’s been low overall, and I find it hard to focus on studying for vet school or even basic tasks sometimes. It’s more like my mind is stuck on replaying the gym situations, not like I’m hyper or anything.

interviewer: It sounds like fatigue and anxiety are taking a toll on your daily life. Let’s briefly check on substances—have you noticed any changes in your alcohol, cannabis, or other drug use recently, including things like energy drinks or supplements?

patient: No, I haven’t started or stopped any substances recently. I don’t use alcohol or cannabis, and I haven’t taken any new supplements or energy drinks. I focus more on diet and workouts, but nothing else that’s changed.

interviewer: It’s important to consider all factors that might contribute to your symptoms. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins on a regular basis?

patient: No, I’m not currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins. My focus has been on diet and exercise, but I haven’t started any specific supplements yet.

interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having thoughts that others are out to get you, even when they’re not?

patient: I haven't heard voices or seen things others don't. But sometimes I feel like people at the gym are watching me or judging me, even when there's no real reason. I guess the anxiety makes me think someone's out to get me... like they'll notice I'm not putting weights back properly and make fun of me, even if they're just going about their own workout.

interviewer: It’s helpful to understand how your anxiety is affecting your life. To ensure we’re considering all factors, have you ever been diagnosed with or experienced any medical conditions that might contribute to these symptoms, such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain?

patient: No, I don’t think so. I’ve always been healthy physically—I just had a bad sprained ankle a few years ago, but nothing like thyroid problems or sleep apnea. Although… my sister has hypothyroidism, but I don’t think I inherited it. I’ve just been feeling tired lately, but that’s probably just from stress.

interviewer: To recap, Wyatt, your anxiety at the gym seems to have started 3 months ago with self-consciousness about gym etiquette, worsened after an incident where someone laughed at you. This has led to avoidance, rushed workouts, and disrupted your motivation for both fitness and vet school studies. The formulation suggests predisposing factors like childhood shyness, a precipitating event (the laughing incident), perpetuating cycles of avoidance and catastrophic thinking, and protective factors like your proactive scheduling and family support. What did I miss, or what feels inaccurate here?

patient: The summary's mention of family support as a protective factor is accurate, but it's important to clarify that I haven't actually talked to my family about this specific anxiety yet. They're supportive in general, but I've kept this to myself. Also, the part about 'proactive scheduling' is technically true—I avoid busy hours—but that’s really just a form of avoidance, not proactive coping. I think that nuance is missing.

interviewer: Thank you for those clarifications, Wyatt. To update our summary: your family support is a protective factor, though you haven’t shared this specific anxiety with them yet, and your avoidance of peak gym hours reflects a pattern of safety-seeking behaviors rather than proactive coping. With that in mind, what would be most helpful for us to explore or address next in our discussion?

patient: I think it would help to talk more about how I can manage the anxiety when it hits, like the racing thoughts at night about the gym. Also, maybe figuring out a way to slowly face the situation instead of rushing or avoiding it. My parents might not realize how much this is affecting my energy and school prep, so learning how to communicate that without feeling embarrassed could be good too.

interviewer: Thank you for those insights, Wyatt. To clarify next steps: we could explore anxiety management techniques for racing thoughts, develop a gradual exposure plan for gym scenarios, and practice communication strategies to share your needs with your family. What did I miss, or how does this align with what you’d like to address?

patient: That all makes sense. The vet school prep part is important too—I feel stuck because I can’t focus on it with this anxiety cycle. Also, even when the gym’s empty, I still get that nervous feeling like people are watching. Could we maybe work on breaking the avoidance habit while building confidence in my routines there?

interviewer: It makes sense to address both breaking the avoidance pattern and building confidence in the gym, even in low-stimulus environments. To wrap up our time today, could you confirm if there’s anything else in this summary that feels off or if there are other concerns we haven’t covered yet?

patient: The summary feels accurate—I don’t see anything off. The part about the vet school stress tying into the gym anxiety is spot on. I guess maybe the racing thoughts at night are worse than I described, but that’s about it.
