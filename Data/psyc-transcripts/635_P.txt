She's cute. Is she single? She is. Hey. Oh, one caveat also. Even if you try to ask her out on a date, she's not sophisticated enough to respond back to your questions yet. That's all right. A lot of my dates aren't. That's never stopped me before. All right, so I'm going to go ahead and start the hand quarter. And this is going to start here. Okay, so she's going to ask you some questions. And then when she's done, she's going to say goodbye. And then you're going to press this button to let me know that you guys are done. She's looking at me so flirtatiously. She nodded at you. Okay, so just a few caveats before we get started. We're working with technology here, and this is kind of a pilot project right now. So there is a chance that some things are not going to go perfectly. So if there is a pause where Ellie doesn't say anything for about 10 to 15 seconds, please press this button and let me know. Because it's probably an indication that something is going wrong. There's also a chance that you're working with speech recognition technology, which if you've ever used Siri on the iPhone, you know it's not perfect. So there's a chance that you may say something that she misunderstands. And she might ask you some follow-up questions that don't pertain to what you just said. So just kind of bear with us. Hopefully everything will go smoothly. But I had to give you some caveats before we got started. Okay. So again, just press this button once she says goodbye. Okay. Okay. Yep. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. How are you? That's great. Where are you from originally? Switzerland. Switzerland. What are some things you really like about L.A.? Do you travel a lot? No. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I don't know. I have to think about it. Whatever comes to your mind? Um, I don't know. What did you study at school? Philosophy. Philosophy. Philosophy. What do you do now? Sales. What's your dream job? Acting. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Both. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, what's your favorite movie? I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Meditate. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. Maybe too good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Um. Can you tell me about that? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe a month ago with my father. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. What comes to your mind? I saw this girl in a store the other day and I wish I'd asked her out. What's something you feel guilty about? I don't know. Um. Not calling my father. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I'd have to think about that. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. It's a little personal. Hmm. I don't know. What's the worst thing about working with someone originally? Mom! Mom! Mom! I think we can keep an eye on her. How ever you guys act? Just a little tired. I'll drive you off now. Uh huh. Oh, run along at 7 to get over it. Yep! Hey, opposites, logicals and fun! All the variance is me. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Challenging. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired, crabby, low energy. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't remember. Tell me more about that. I don't remember. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Catherine Gately. Can you tell me about that? She's a teacher that I had. She loved me. How would your best friend describe you? Nice guy. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I had a date the other day. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? Nothing. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye-bye.
