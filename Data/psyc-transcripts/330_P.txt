So, how are you doing today? Very good. That's good. Where are you from originally? L.A. Really? What are some things you really like about L.A.? It's sunny. And it's near the ocean. The traffic can make it difficult. It's difficult to drive around between different places. And there's a lack of open spaces if you're not near the beach. Do you travel a lot? No. Why? Um. I haven't planned on. I haven't finalized any travel plans. Okay. What do you do for a living? Listen to music. Cool. Do you consider yourself a traveler? Yeah. Why? Um. Um. Well, I tend to excel at things that have to do with, um. Spending time alone versus things that have to do with, uh, spending time outside with, uh, lots of people. Okay. How are you at controlling your time? I'm reasonable. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what were you about? Um. Maybe, maybe yesterday. I was trying to figure out what I was talking about. Trying to figure out how to, uh, pack something into the car. How are you at controlling your time? I'm pretty good at it. What do you do when you're in the water? I breathe in and out. Like that. Okay. That's good. What are you doing to increase your time? Uh. Like, uh, you know. Jogging, walking, bicycling, reading, listening, listening to music. Awesome. What did you study at school? Uh. Math, engineering, computers. Are you still working at that? Uh. A little bit. Yeah. What do you do now? Um. I'm a student. I'm going back to school for, uh, biological sciences. How did you decide to do that? Um. I started doing some reading on, um, some textbooks. Okay. So, um. What's your dream job? Dream job. Um. Medical doctor. Really? How hard is that? Uh. It's. I guess it depends on what type of medicine you practice. Okay. So, um. I work in a pharmacy. Oh. I have a doctorate in biology. Oh. Uh. I have a mentor. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I have a mentor. He has a lot of positive, um, thoughts, and, you know, it's always, it's always, it's always, suggestions. How do you know them? Through a professional so I met someone through a class and then they worked with them professionally. So it's I guess you could say through an academic or professional channel. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? ... Let's see. ... ... ... I can't think of one at the moment. Okay. Why don't we talk about that later? ... Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I don't think so, no. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It takes me a little while to fall asleep, but once I'm asleep, it's reasonably okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? ... ... I think I'm a little forgetful and nervous. ... Okay. Have you ever said anything to someone? ... ... No. Do you feel alone? Sometimes. Can you tell me about that? ... What do you want to know? ... ... ... ... ... ... Well, I think sometimes I do think about challenges ahead of me. ... ... And that can be a little daunting, and I feel down. ... That sounds really hard. It is very hard. How do you cope with that? Go for a walk. Read a book. Listen to some music. ... ... Are you triggered by something? ... ... ... ... ... I don't. I mean, I'm sure they are. I'm not specifically sure what triggers anything. Maybe feeling overwhelmed or not feeling particularly tied to some task. ... ... ... ... I don't go to a therapist. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I guess through classes. ... ... ... ... ... ... I think I went on a walk at night. A day ago. Okay. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself to end your time on your own? Can you repeat that? What advice would you give yourself to end your time on your own? Can you rephrase that? Let's come back to that later. What do you think of the new kid? I think they're lucky. Very lucky. Got everything in front of them. Yeah. What are you most proud of in life? Most proud of... Maybe academic achievements. Achievements? Tell me more about that. I guess just the time I've spent studying math and science. That's great. Hmm. When was the last time you felt really happy? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I'm not sure. I don't know. I think I've lost everything I needed. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
