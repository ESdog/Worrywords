And now I'm going to bring up our virtual human just for a second here so you can see what she looks like. And then I'm going to shrink her back down as I continue setting everything up. I'm going to go ahead and put this behind you. And I'm going to look over your ears just like that. Perfect. Yeah. It's the same one. Make sure this doesn't get in your way. There we go. Perfect. Just like that. Great. There she is. I'm going to shrink her back down and things are going to keep setting up here. So just a couple of caveats before we get started. This is relatively new technology. So unfortunately, Ellie doesn't, she's our virtual human. She doesn't quite yet have the capability to answer questions. So she'll be the one asking all the questions today. Also, you'll notice that she does pause sometimes here and there to listen to what you're saying. If you notice a pause that's greater than about 10 seconds, I'd go ahead and press this button. You know, we're working with technology here. Everyone can watch. I don't know if something can go wrong. It's Friday already. Yeah, maybe she'll get tired. Please. All right. So if that happens, go ahead and press this button. She wants to get out and take a vacation. Sure. Okay, I'm going to start up the recording. And what's going to happen is she's going to ask you questions. And then at the end, she'll say goodbye.
