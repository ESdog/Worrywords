Okay, great. So I'm going to set up all the recordings now. Oops. Sorry. I have to put up. Yeah. It's kind of weird. Okay. Good. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's like a fake therapist. Does she talk back? Yes. Oh, my gosh. How? And I'll explain after this is over how it all works. So there's, like, nobody, like, making her do anything? Or you can tell me later. Yeah, I'll tell you. Okay. Like, why she was designed and everything. Okay. All right, so what do I do? Just do what she says? You can start talking to her. Okay. And ask her questions. And you said, if I don't want to answer, I can just say I don't want to answer. I don't want to talk about that. I don't want to talk about that. However you want to put it, she'll move on. And then you'll press this button to let me know that you're all done. She'll let you know when you're done. The wild. Okay, cool. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I'm a creative talk to people in the space and security environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and to learn about you. I'll ask if you'd like to. Okay. Atlanta, Georgia. In 2006. How often do you go back to your hometown? Never. Why? I don't like it there. Okay. How does it compare to L.A.? Oh, it's completely boring. And there's very little to do. L.A. is preferable, I think, to most places. I see. Why do you go to L.A.? Because. I was. I was engaged to my fiance and we lived in Florida. I moved there to be with him and he loved the water, but I love the mountains and I missed hiking and I didn't love Florida and he wasn't tied to it. So we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we could both be happy and also have more opportunities and business and all of the great things that it has to offer. That's good. How about you? What do you think about L.A.? Very. Very easy. What do you think you really like about L.A.? There's not much I don't like about L.A. I love L.A. I think it feels magical. So many creative, different people of all ages, shapes, sizes, colors, races, the mountains, the water. The city, all the things that there are to do, all of the different people there are to meet. I just I love everything about L.A. That's so good to hear. I'm sure you can tell them as well. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No. Why? I'd rather not talk about it. Okay. What do you study at school? I'm a student. I didn't go to college. What's good for you now? I'm still figuring that out. Can you tell me about that? I don't know. It may have something to do with animals. I have a dog that I really love, and I never had a dog as an adult. I had cats. I think I'm a late bloomer. So I'm working on that whole process of trying to get my dog to have that kind of conversation. I don't, I really don't want a job. I want a purposeful way to create wealth, not just something to make money in the long run. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? It depends on the situation, but in general, I consider myself more shy, although most people would consider me to be outgoing. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the big pink screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I turn on classical music. Music, classical music if I'm especially stressed and play with my dog, go for a walk. How do you do it controlling your hunger? I think I'm really good at controlling my hunger. I temper for the most part. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? Before I came here. It was just about financial stress. Tell me about a situation that you would see as a different one. Really personal. There's probably a lot of examples. Would you hand out your��.com to anybody with elderly children who has an issue such as anxiety and depression, or even if they're an addiction vendo at a mental hospital? Right. I'd rather not talk about that either. I'd rather not talk about that. Not very easy at all. What are you like when you don't sleep well? A lot better recently, but I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems, so it's challenging not to feel rested most of the time. How have you been feeling lately? In the past week, I've been feeling a lot better. Can you tell me about that? Yes, the weather has changed. Spring has sprung. It's a little warmer. I was having more trouble with my depression in the winter and I'm having trouble with tolerating cold. And so I wasn't doing a lot of the things that I normally do. And I also was sick with the flu. And in the past week, I decided to go to the doctor. I was feeling better enough that I needed to get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that I need to do during the day. And walking my dog every day and not isolating so much. And seeing some of my friends more. So I've been feeling a lot better. Like I've been making progress. And that in the past week, things have taken a more positive turn. That's great! Have you ever been diagnosed with Dyslexia? No. Have you been diagnosed with Dyslexia? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? It's been quite some time. Officially, it's probably been... I don't know exactly. But let's see. Maybe more than 15 years ago. What got you into Dyslexia? I was feeling suicidal. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? Because I found a better alternative. Why did you stop? Tell me more about that. I've been in therapy off and on since I was 18. And I've tried a variety of methods. And then I started working with a neuro-linguistic programmer. And that was really the first person that helped me make permanent changes. And I was able to get off my anti-depressants as well. Even though I've struggled with some amounts of depression, it's never been anything extremely severe. And it was one of the best things that ever happened. How did you decide to do that? Well, I was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome. And I had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her. And he was a doctor. And he was a doctor of that disease. And that was, he treats multiple issues. And so everything is interrelated. So once I had my first conversation with him, I knew it was the right step for me. How did you clearly remember him? I was so happy. I felt like I, some, I felt that I found the answer that I'd been looking for. That I hadn't given up hope. And I was happy. And that I was like on cloud nine. That I had been suffering for a long time. And I felt that I finally found the answer to the solution that I was looking for. It was like, it was the best thing I ever did in my life. It was the best decision I ever made. I felt extremely hopeful for the first time in a long time. How did that show the music in your life? Um, I went to, um, I went to a music store. Because, uh, I was so busy. I had been thinking about, um, taking up an instrument. I used to play the violin as a child. And, uh, I've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side. Because I felt it's been extremely repressed. And, um, and so I went to the music store to try out, um, to see what it would feel like to, um, to handle the instrument again. And see if I thought that that was something that I would want to pursue. Awesome. It was awesome. How was it like studying on a real weekend? Um, yeah, I'd rather not talk about that. Okay. What are some things you wish you had done? What are some things you think about yourself? Um. Well. There's probably a lot, but, um. I'm always working on being more optimistic. Um. It's been challenging. It takes time. But, um. Yeah, I wish I could hear my own internal voice better. Mm-hmm. Is there anything you remember? Yeah. I don't know. Oh, you think about, um, euh. I have regrets, sure. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself two months or 20 minutes ago? Um. Value myself more so that I would make better relationship decisions. Yeah. My fiancé is the most positive person in my life, my ultimate supporter. Can you tell me about that? He's, I think, very unique, not at all selfish, and probably a little too giving for his own good, but always has my best interests at heart, has the highest morals of anyone I know, would give somebody the shirt off of his back, is a genius in the sense that he is a very good person in so many ways, and I'm pretty lucky, I think. What is the most positive in your life? That I'm not a quitter, that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time I haven't... I'm not a quitter. I don't want to talk about this, but I've been childless for a long time and I'll never As long as I can say you were by my side, I'm yours. I think it's incredible, that you always can still be who you are, so I know you will Thank you.
