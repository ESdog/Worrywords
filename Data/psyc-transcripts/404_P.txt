Wow, she looks determined. All right. As I said, she'll ask you some questions. When she's done, she will let you know, and you'll press this button. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get it started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good. Doing good. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York City. Really? Once you moved to LA. Well, originally I was born here, but I spent some time back east and moved back here and was basically sort of raised here. So, been here a while and I'm enjoying it. What are some things you really like about LA? There's great weather and amusement parks, a lot of scenery, a lot of people, a lot of energy and excitement. There's so many things to really like about LA. Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I wouldn't very beautiful for example traveling on a bus. Yeah, I wish there was like over 90% of people who generally like traveling on a bus. I imagine, there are like per COVID thing going on. Great. You had a job? At killing the cops. I was out of the gameique. Yeah. It's nice to be in the open road with plenty of time to think about my own life. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Shy. Why? Sometimes I find it hard to express my own thoughts. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank's screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Well, you mentioned the fish tank and I've spent some time in many waiting rooms. I've been to many places where there have been fish tanks. Staring at fish tanks could be one of them. I also enjoy walking, lifting weights, reading, going to movies. Just to say a few things. That's good. How are you at controlling your hunger? Good. Moderate. Good. In control. Good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Argued about today. Okay, last argument was today. Just before I got here. And it was about taking them to a bus stop. About making an arrangement. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Feel guilty about not taking better care of my pet. Can you tell me about that? Sure. I like birds. So one of my pets was a bird as of recently. And I let my bird out into the wild and sort of wish I had planned for a better future for the bird. Only because now I sort of wish the bird was closer to me. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Hmm. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I would say I get into arguments with people close to me, friends. And sometimes I don't handle them well. I am more reactive. So I wish I'd like to see myself improve on that. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. At least not in any sort of legal trouble. But I think it's kind of not the way that I would like to have handled it. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Wow. Hmm. Hmm. I guess the hardest decision was about to or of. Moving forward on a job opportunity. Tell me about that. I had to decide whether if I would suffer more emotional pain by leaving my family. And whether the financial gain and knowledge that I had in my family would be enough to make me feel better. And whether the financial gain and knowledge that I had in my family would be enough to make me feel better. Or if I would be able to provide as much help as I could to the people. And whether that experience would would over outweigh the benefit. That sounds really hard. Are you happy with your job? Uh, yes. Yes, I am. That's good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I. It's a small family but. But I have a mother and a sister and a brother and two younger nieces. Older, they're grown adults. It's a good relationship. And things could be better. Sometimes it's sort of difficult, pain, staking relationships at times. There's some days I need time for myself. And I would rather give the time to other people rather than the table. I would rather take time for myself, which has been my experience. And so that has caused me a lot of emotional pain, a little bit of spiritual anxiety about my future if I continue to do that sort of thing. Yeah. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Wow, there's so many things. What about you? I don't know anything about you. I would say, well, there's a few. But of recent, I... Wow. Things are going pretty good. I can't really say there's anything as of yet that I would really want to change. Or have anything to regret on that I can remember. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's been pretty good. And... So I'd say it's okay. I'm handling my sleep pretty well. What are you like when you don't sleep well? When I don't sleep? Well, sometimes I can be irritable. Sometimes it's okay. And I would say if there's also times where I'm unhappy. So I try to get as much sleep as I need. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been in combat? How old were you when you were in the military? I... I believe I was 19. And... I'm glad I did it. You were very young, weren't you? Yes. Sort of. But... Yes. Did you ever see combat? No. How does serving in the military change you? Well... I guess I suppose it made me a more confident person. And more... in tune with... the country that I'm living in. And people... to be more noticeable, more watchful of where I live. Mm-hmm. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Um... hanging out with some friends... on a really nice weekend. And... on a boat. Or on a skiff. A really small boat. And... um... trying to fish. And... Nice! How did you feel in that moment? I felt... free or alive. Um... happy. Um... uninhibited. Strong. Confident. Um... mature. Mm-hmm. What did you do after the military? Um... After the military... After the military... Uh... After the military... took some time to evaluate my... my thoughts and... uh... my future. And... um... just sort of took the necessary steps to move ahead. How hard is that? Uh... It's... sort of hard. It is. Um... How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? Uh... It wasn't easy. Uh... A lot of family... um... help. And, um... and community. And, um... So it took some adjusting, but it wasn't easy. I understand. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Uh... No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh... You know... This week? Um... Partially today. Happy... Happy sort of often. Not too happy, but... content. Happy? Happy... I don't know. Um... Not usually too happy. Try to stay... on the center line. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Ideal weekend? Um... Up early. Um... Get out... Enjoy the day. Um... Hook up with some friends. And, um... Doing a little bit of socializing. And, uh... Maybe get some form of, um... view some form of artistic expression. Like what? Maybe like a museum or stare at some art or maybe something in the local community. Maybe street art. Or perhaps something with music. Or something of that nature. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish perhaps some things that I could change about myself. Be more decisive about decisions. And... Yeah. Something else. That I... Had the same ability for enact for... For meeting more people, I suppose. How would your best friend describe you? Best friend describe me? I don't know. Nice. Friendly. Trustworthy. Sociable. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? The same advice I gave myself today. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you didn't do. Something you really enjoyed. Something... Wow. Um... I really enjoyed spending time with my girlfriend and her two children. And that was yesterday. And I'm glad I did that. It was a good time for everybody. That's great. Thank you. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud I went into the military. And... I'm glad I did that. It was a good experience. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to.
