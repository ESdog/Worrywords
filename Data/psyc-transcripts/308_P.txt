I meditate and I skateboard. I can meditate on my board. Can you say a little more about that? I meditate. It helps me relax. Sometimes if I don't really feel like skating hard, I'll just go for a nice sunset skate and meditate. A nice two hour skate and just relax. That sounds like a great situation. How hard is that? It's not that hard. You just gotta get to the skate spots. I usually like skating. There's some good skate spots in LA. Streets in LA. The beaches is always good. Nice. It's really not that hard at all. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? The situation with my life right now. I can't find a fucking job. It can be tough to find a good job these days. I don't even care about a good job. I just need a job. Anything that pays. It just gets hard after a while. Yeah. Can you tell me about that? I applied from anywhere and everywhere. From entry level to management. To anywhere in between. And um... I can't find a job. I can't get a job. So... I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.

Do you do it that way often? Yes. At this, that happens often. When was the last time that happened? Uh... last night I couldn't sleep. Why? Um... Just thinking about my situation. Um... A car payment was due yesterday. And I just... I don't know if I have what it takes to continue to do this. You know... I survive day by day. Trying to... see if I can eat. At the end of the day. Um... Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Um... About three years ago. Four years ago. Couple years ago. What got you to seek help? Um...

It has been useful for me in the past. Is it useful for me now? I don't know. I don't have health insurance. Um... I would love to talk to someone. I just feel like... I don't have anyone. So... I don't depend on anyone. Yeah. I'm sorry. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Oh yeah. I've always felt depressed in my life. What were your symptoms? Um... Lack of energy. Wanting to sleep a lot. Lack of interest. My appetite was uncontrollable. Either lack of or I was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things.

How close are you to your family? Um... Pretty dysfunctional family. You know, really can't depend on them. That's why I just depend on myself. So... That sounds really hard. It is what it is. What are you going to do? Yeah. I'd like to give up, but... My parents just buried their daughter six months ago. They don't want to bury their other daughter. So... What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um... I don't know. I don't know. I'm just, uh, I just haven't had this life. I was a corporate manager for 20 years. And, uh... Who would have known 20 years ago that I would have to go through that. what advice I would have given myself because I tried to commit suicide instead of returning back to work. And so now it's just, it's been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and get my life back together. I don't know what advice I would give myself when I started with my corporate job 20 years ago. Because I didn't know I'd be here 20 years later. Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. Really happy? A couple days ago this week. I've been trying to make ends meet. I've got a lot of things sprouting. I've got a lot of things that are happening for me. But I need like two more weeks. Yeah. Here in LA. So I can connect the dots. But financially I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. So I was happy because I was getting callbacks and things were starting to look up for me. But it's just time again isn't on my side. So my car is packed and I'm hitting the road. And I'm taking off and I'm leaving LA. So I'm going to LA. Hmm. How would your best friend describe you? Uh, loyal. Emotional. Strong. Good. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Um. I have been lately. Um, I was an extrovert for 20 years when I was a corporate manager. And now I am quite an introvert. And I speak to myself. What made you decide to do that? Um, circumstances in my life. I don't feel as confident. I don't feel as, uh, confident. I don't feel as charming. And as social. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Um. I don't know. It's hard to say. Can't really answer that one. Okay. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Oh, shit. . I'm going to go ahead and shut everything down. And then we just have a quick little survey for you guys.
