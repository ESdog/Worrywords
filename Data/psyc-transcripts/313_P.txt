I really like the sunshine, all the opportunities, all the different kinds of people, lots of stuff to do. That sort of thing. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I hate the traffic. I wish the seasons were more distinct. And everything costs a lot of money here. I see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get used to living in LA? Pretty easy. That's good. What are some things that make you really happy? Umm. Let's see. I'd say, uh, people are rude. Umm. Not having enough money. Uhh, what else? Just a lot of things are frustrating, I guess. What do you do when you're annoyed? I guess it depends on what I'm annoyed about. Like, is that another person? Or about something I did? Or just life in general? Mmhmm. Can you give me an example of that? Uhh. If somebody, like a person annoys me, I'll probably let them know they're annoying me. Until they stop. Uh huh. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Okay. How are you at controlling your hunger? Uhh. So-so. Not as good as I'd like to be. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? Uhh. A few days ago about getting paid for something I did on time. How did you feel at that moment? Uhh. Pretty pissed off. Taken advantage of. Yeah. What do you think you like to do with your friends? I like to go to the gym. Uhh. Hang out with friends. Read. Write. That sort of thing. What do you consider yourself to be the right? At times. Why? Uhh. Because. Sometimes I like to keep my friends.

That was pretty memorable. Really? Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that. Let's see. It was pretty different than anything I've ever experienced. It was a lot of fun, exposed to a lot of new things and new people. I was pretty young, carefree, good times. Did you travel a lot? I must have been able to go on a trip. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Of what? Yes, anything in life? Yes. Let's see. Boy, that's a good question. Moving to L.A. was pretty memorable. It took me a lot of hard work.

Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yeah, a while ago. How long ago were you diagnosed? Uh, hmm. I don't know exactly. It's been a few years. But I still feel the same as I did when they diagnosed me. So I assume I'm still depressed. What got you to tell it? I'm not sure. Uh, well, I just, I'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems. So I just thought that would be a good idea. So I did. And that's what I found out.

Thanks. How did you get into the profession? Well, I haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se, but when you talk to somebody who listens, and you get stuff out there, like out of your head or whatever, it helps to de-stress, I think.

Being able to survive on my own in a city like this, completely on my own, with no outside help. Is there anything you've learned? Yeah, lots of stuff. Can you give me an example of that? Just dumb mistakes I made when I was younger that, looking back now with what I know now, I probably would not have made. What advice would you give yourself as a person who doesn't know? I would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on your life? Hmm.
