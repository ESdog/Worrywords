Okay. All right, so now I'm going to start at the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll say goodbye. And I will put the doorbell over here so you can let me know when you're all done, okay? Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with me saying I am? Yeah. So-so. Nebraska. Work. I've been coming here off and on for years but officially moved here a couple years ago. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Yeah, I see what you mean. What are some things you really like about LA? Nebraska. You know, more opportunities to do different things and explore different things, areas, interests. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The crime. Attitude. Lack of-lack of work ethic. Lack of kindness in people. Cutthroat. Do you travel a lot? I used to. Quite a bit. What do you enjoy about traveling? Sense of freedom. The adventure. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Um, okay. Okay. Okay. You want me to tell you about a trip? Yes. Uh, Egypt. Awesome. Yeah. Tell me more about that. I went with my mother and some family friends. We went on an eight day cruise down the Nile. Saw all the pyramids in Giza. Um, just-it was just an incredible adventure. Just to get away from everything and everybody and-and, uh, close friends. And just to have a great time. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. How close are you to your family? Um, not really at all. Why? Um, just a-a history of, um, abuse and-and neglect and, uh, just not a real function. Just a very dysfunctional family. Dysfunctional is-is definitely a key word in our family. So. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about death? Um, no, not really. I've talked about it a lot before. Um, so. I'm okay with it. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Um, I don't know. I think it's really hard to say. I haven't had very good, uh, very positive role models. Um, um, ask me the question again. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Well, maybe at best my mother. But, uh, she's-she's also been a negative, uh, aspect of my life. But, um, uh, yeah, I guess I can't really identify anybody who's been a real, real positive influence in my life. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Um, the-the trips that I've been on. Cool. Yeah. What do you do to relax? Um, I used to work out. I used to do yoga. I used to, um, I used to meditate. I used to exercise. I used to, um, I used to do a lot of things. Lately, um, I find it, uh, hard to relax. I don't have the same, uh, the same, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Probably, um, having the same outlets that I did before, the same, uh, as I, I don't pursue them as much anymore. I guess I'm, I lost my motivation or something. I'm depressed about it, you know, that I guess there it is right there. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Um, pretty good. far as getting to the point of physicality, I don't ever that. But I stand my ground and but I can control my temper. I never lose control really. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time? Probably as recently as, you know, in the last month or so I maybe argued with an acquaintance over... I don't know. I have to come back to that question. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever... Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Well, officially October of last year, but I think I've been depressed longer than that. But officially October of last year. What got you to seek help? Actually, I was being treated for other medical issues and my depression was notable to the doctors. Really? Yeah. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? Well, I've never been suicidal, but just to... I just often have thought... I don't have much reason to live. I used to think I had a purpose and such, but I don't really have anybody in my life who I think cares enough about me that I was even dead. So, I've kind of lost myself. And I used to... There used to be enough that I was enough to... You know, to have purpose in my life, but I've lost quite a bit of that. Yeah. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Well, I'm trying to pull it together. I'm trying to... get back a sense of me. I get inspired every once in a while, but overall I just don't seem to be making much progress. Do you still go to therapy now? Yeah. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I wouldn't really call it therapy. I don't have a therapist per se. I have a... a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me. And nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues. It sucks. Uh-huh. Did you say that sucks? Okay. Yeah. How have you been feeling lately? Um... Overwhelmed. Preoccupied. Um... Just trying to stay alive. Stay on top of things. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh... Easy when I can. I don't... Um... Yeah. When I... If I get a chance to fall asleep I don't have any problem with it. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um... Even more distracted and... Um... Even more... Lackluster I guess is the word. Sounds really hard. Whatever. Talk about it when you're in your good How would your best friend describe you? If I had a best friend? I don't know. Maybe a lot of positive adjectives before, but now just, you know, just... Some people say I should be proud because I'm surviving a hard time, or some people think that I'm a loser. So, I don't know. Maybe a survivor. Persistent. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? What I used to be proud of? My career and kind of giving back to people, giving back to society, because I was given a lot, it felt like. So, I'm just proud to... I don't have much of a sense of pride anymore, to be quite honest. I've... I don't know. Okay. What did you study at school? Psychology. And, well, initially, yeah. Are you still working in that? No, not really per se, although my current career involves a lot of psychology, a lot of the aspects. I don't know what I'm trying to say. It's a part of it, but it's not the center of it. Hi, businessman. What do you do now? Well, I guess if my career is still going, I'm in nursing, but I've been sick lately. And with depression and other health care problems, I have found it necessary to apply for disability. I don't know. I'm in Social Security income, and I'm starting the process of that, because I'm not working. How hard is that? Very. What's your dream job? Educating people, making a difference. I mean, I used to... I had my... I've had my dream jobs. I've had my dream jobs. I don't... I don't know what the future will hold for work, but something, I suppose, working with people again. Health. Helping in some way. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No, but lately with the depression, more so at times. Uh-huh. Is there anything you regret? I used to say that I never regretted anything, because I would make the best decision of all things in front of me. But, um... I just wish there were times then that, um, the choices that I would have were... were better. Because some choices that I seemed to have made... or were made for me have, um, made my world kind of shitty. For lack of a better word. Shitty. Can you give me an example of that? What? I don't understand. Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Uh... To be strong. To... To be... To, um, believe in myself. To remember that I've survived a lot of things, and I'll survive this too. To get up off my ass and move. To, um... To have confidence. Faith. Um... I just... Murphy's Law has kicked my ass... so much. You know? I just, uh... It seems like when I've tried to make my world better, I just keep getting knocked down. Um... So... It's almost like I'm... I don't want to give up, but, um... Every time I try and move forward, I get knocked back. And it gets... It's exhausting. And I don't have any support system, really. Nobody. Not really. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Um... Loyal. Um... Hardworking. Um... Dependable. Um... Capable. Loyal. Um... Well, at least I used to be. Uh... Uh... Intelligent. Contemplative. Um... Deep. Not a superficial person. Um... Yeah. I guess those are some of the... Okay. When was the last time you felt like you were a good person? Really happy. Many years ago. Can you tell me about that? Um... I used to have a lot of confidence. I used to be... A pretty dynamic person. I used to be... People used to say that I was the most centered person that they knew. And I used to... Help people. And I'm now in their shoes. I don't seem to be able to help myself. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Uh... I was really happy. I'm sorry. I just... I... I can't think of anything right now. I can't think of really anything right now. What are some things you like to do for fun? I don't do much anything for fun anymore. I used to, however, go to movies and entertainment venues and travel. Go to dinner with friends, do things. But lately I don't really have any pursuits. A good day, a happy day, a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong, basically. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
