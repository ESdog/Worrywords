There we go. Perfect. Okay, looks good. Oh, actually, before that, one thing I almost forgot. I could use something that syncs their equipment. There we go. All right. Yes. I'm all right. Los Angeles, California. Yep. The lights. Big city. It's always something going on. Yeah. The traffic. And... That's it. Business administration and business management. Not that. I'm doing something else. I'm doing networking at the moment. Hmm. To open up a big clothing line and just supply the whole world with clothing. Yeah. I'm going to be able to love this world. Definitely. Why? Uh... Because I'm all about myself. It's all about me. Do you feel that way often? Not often, but more times than not. Yeah. What are some things that you do really not? Being lied to and I guess when people think you're dumber than what you are. I understand. What do you do when you're annoyed? Try to get away from everything. Go into my own space. How are you at controlling your temper? Very well. I'm great at controlling my temper. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Okay. Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? I like to see new faces, new environment. I'd love to hear about your trip. Let me see. The last trip I had was Vegas. You know how Vegas goes. It was pretty fun. There was a lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on. Nice. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Um. Um. I'm pretty open minded. I'm kind to pretty much everybody. I'm a pretty even keeled guy. How do you like your living situation? It's alright. It could be better. Do you have roommates? No. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No ma'am. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh lately it's been pretty tough. I guess because I've been staying up so late. But that's my fault. Why? I don't know. I guess I'm a night owl all of a sudden. I'm turning into an owl. Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Sluggish and tired all day. If I don't sleep well all day. I'm just laying around. Have you noticed any changes in your living here or your hospital? No. Not too much. Okay. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay focused and listen to the adults. Do you have done any exercise? Do you want anything to avoid it? Yeah. Tell me more about that. I mean self-explanatory. I think I just listen to parents or other adults that try to steer you in the right way. And you know you're being a stubborn kid at that at those ages. So it's like what? What are you talking about? This is my life. I can do what I want. I don't have to listen to you. But now I see that what they were telling me was correct. Okay. How are your best friends? Hilarious. Okay. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Both my parents, mother and father. That's great. I'm glad you're here. How about something you did recently that you really enjoyed? Recently. What did I do? New Year's Eve party. I had the time of my life. It was so fun. I'd love to hear all about it. This New Year's Eve I went to a party at a friend's house in Ballin Hills area. He had it at a pretty nice house. It's a three-story house and it was like 350 people in there. It was pretty fun but it was also not that fun because it was so many people and you couldn't really move. So that was the only downfall. Besides that, I brought my New Year in great with tons of friends and that's how it's supposed to be done. Awesome. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? I'm generally in a good mood every day. Waking up puts me in a good mood. I guess you could say that. I don't know. A good meal. That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? One of my most memorable? I don't know. My most memorable experiences were probably when I was younger. I was in the Boy Scouts and we used to go camping all the time. One year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite, one of those places, and we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge. Of course, being from the city, I'm a mountain biking. I can ride a mountain bike. Once we got into the real mountains and got on real mountain bikes, I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers. It was fun and pretty intense. Going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense. I'll never forget that. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a tough one to answer. What am I most proud of? I don't know, honestly. Okay. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye.
