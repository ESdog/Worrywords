That's the other question I had. My number 358, that doesn't mean there was, does that mean there was like 357 other people before me? Okay, that's what I was thinking, yeah. Yeah. There's been 58. Oh, okay. Yeah, each study starts with like a different number, like a 200 or a 300. Oh, okay. All right, well, there she is. And I will put the doorbell back for you to call in the next. Okay, cool. Thank you. Thanks. She'll get started? Yep. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions, then I'll start it. And please feel free to comment on anything. Your answers are of great confidence. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? Fine. Where are you from or where are you from? Tampa, Florida. Why did you move to LA? At that point, I wanted to get into the entertainment industry. When did you move to LA? 1990. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It took a long time to get used to it. It wasn't easy. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, the weather. And... I think that if you have a hobby, you could always find a large group of people that are interested in the same hobbies you have. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, some of the people in the business world, you know, it's pretty transient. They come and go, and it's kind of difficult as far as if you, you know, trusting people in the business world has been difficult. How often do you go back to your hometown? No. Not much at all. How does it compare to LA? It's quite different. The weather's different. The people are different. It's very different. Do you travel a lot? No. What did you study at school? God, it was so long ago. School. Just general stuff. Business. Acting. That kind of thing. What do you do now? Well, I'm working on becoming a professional poker player. And I left the stock brokerage industry successfully to do financial trading, stock options, futures, that kind of stuff. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Sometimes, yes. What are some things that make you really happy? People, my family. Just people, you know, making fun of me. Or just instigators. Just being around negative, hostile people. What do you do when you're annoyed? I vent. Ruminate over the same situation over and over again. How are you at controlling your humbler? Pretty darn good. When was the last time you had a humbler? I don't remember. I can't remember. Argued with someone. I can't really remember. That's a good sign. I don't argue much these days. Maybe online? Not really. I don't know. That's a good, good, good change. I don't know. What can I argue with somebody about? Maybe, it's been a long time. I can't really remember. Huh. There's someone that's been in positive mode for a while. Who do you think you like to be with more than you like? Oh, I'd say Tony Robbins. Anthony Robbins. What do you think you like to do for fun? Listen to music. Surf the internet. Study poker. Research on stocks. Watch YouTube clips. How close are you to your family? More towards my sister. My sister's not my parents. I'm not close at all with my parents. Been estranged. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Um, not officially, but some people say I do have the symptoms of it. When I've been talking about depression. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Um, I was diagnosed in the early 1990s with like dysthymia, which is like a mild form of depression, I think, or a long-term lasting mild depression. What got you into this health? A friend had thought he had a learning disability. Um, called attention deficit disorder. At that time it was ADHD. So, when I looked at the literature, it seemed similar to the symptoms that I had. So then I went to go through the same battery of tests that he did at UCLA. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? It's more of a financial thing. Do you feel like therapy's useful? Yes. How have you been doing lately? Um, I'm not sure. Um, irritable, moody, tired. Have you had a study done when you've been in a busy year or a long period? Yes. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not easy. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Air-headed, spacey, um, slow. How do you cope with that? How do I do what? How do you cope with that? Cope with what? How do I? I'll come back to that later. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? Oh. I can't remember. Tell me about something you've been doing lately. What are the things that you really enjoy? Played poker online. Is there anything you regret? Um, yes. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Wow, that's a good question. Um, 10 or 20 years ago, I would have said to stay away from losers. Avoid negative people. Don't try to change them. Don't try to give them advice. Don't try to help them out. Don't try to show them the right way. It's just a waste of your energy, my energy. Don't do business with unethical people. New York City wise guys. New York City type wise guys. You know, chronic liars, BSers. And, uh, what I said, kept my room in better order. Dated more women. Date more women. Clean my room. Do a better job of, you know, enjoying my nice apartment. And my single bachelor's. And my childhood. And... What do you most have in your life? Probably surviving my difficult childhood with my dysfunctional family. Staying out of trouble. Staying away from drugs. Illegal drugs. Um... Making a name for myself as a good stock trader, good stock picker. And sort of my wisdom I've been able to pass on about Eastern philosophy. How would your best friend describe you? Honest. Trustworthy. What would you say is one of your best qualities? Honesty. Mmm... Perseverance. Knowledgeable. Being able to help people. Give them advice about different things. Pretty... I've got a good amount of wisdom without having PhDs or degrees. You know? Excuse me. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. I will be abiding with you.
