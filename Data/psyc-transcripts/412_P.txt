Takk for ating med. Yes. Yes. Okay. Originally from Texas. A few weeks ago. I've been living in Palm Springs, actually, so L.A. there's a lot more to do and the weather's a lot better. For work. Yes. The weather, the beach, a lot of activities, things to do. Traffic. Traffic. And the rental is a lot higher here. I see. How easy is it for you to get used to living in L.A.? At first it was a little difficult, but then I adapted. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Just in the United States. What do you enjoy about traveling? New experiences. Learn a lot of things. I must be there when you could. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Awesome! What did you study at school? How did you decide to do that? Are you still working on it? A little bit, not too much. What's your dream job? Probably, I think to have like a little magazine. Like what? Well, I've already started it. It's like a small local magazine that has coupons. I'm going to expand it to different parts of California. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? Probably shy. Why? Well, let's see. Not, I guess not as outgoing as many of my friends. Okay. So, what's your favorite thing to do? Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on this big pink screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, I go dancing. I like dancing. It's relaxing to me. Nice. When was the last time you hung out? I do Latin dancing, so I do it several times a week. So, last week I went. That's great. How are you at controlling your number? Very good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? I think I argued with someone a couple of weeks back. It was about a religion, religious issue. How did you feel in that moment? Felt okay. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you would see as a different one. Let's see. I can't think of one right now. Let's see. Maybe when I was doing one of my real estate sales. Can you tell me about that? I was... I was... Sometimes the clients are pretty difficult. And I think I should have been like a little more assertive with them. I can't think of one. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. Hmm. Probably moving to California. Tell me more about that. Well, I was leaving my friends and family in Texas and pretty much starting a new life out in California, out here. How hard is that? Well, it was pretty difficult, but I got adjusted. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I have only an aunt and a few cousins left, so it's not too much of a relationship. I have a great aunt that's the sister of my mom. And I send her texts periodically, but most of the time I really don't have my family. I'm not a big family person, so I don't have much contact with family. Hmm. Is there someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Um... Probably parents. Both have been very supportive. Tell me about moving, or something that you would have to take away from your marriage. Hmm. Probably when the parents were sick. Hmm. And passed away. I'm sorry to hear that. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? No. Can you tell me about that? Well, both parents were... I got sick and got dementia, and one parent didn't remember who I was. So that part was pretty difficult. Wow. How do you cope with them? Well, they passed away, so it's just been about ten years, so it's just memories now. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good next week? Hmm. Not too easy. Why? Uh... Just tossing and turning all night, I think, and probably thinking too much about things. Like what? Uh... Probably like the future, things like the economy, and my work, things like that. Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Uh... Tired. How do you get up? I'm very early. Tired. Have you ever seen any of the people you've met and talked to lately? Uh... Just not as positive. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt very happy. Uh... Probably, uh... A few weeks ago, I received a pretty good real estate commission, so I was happy about that. That's good. How much have you spent your real weekend? Uh... When I'm in L.A., um... Going to some of the meet-up groups or some of the, uh...

Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh... I think I was in the gym. Probably my boss. He's pretty, uh... condescending. And, um... Really likes to belittle people. And, uh... Put him, uh... put himself as the king. So, he... Says a lot of comments to make himself... build himself up and, uh... Belittle whoever else is in the room. Oh, no. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. Uh... Uh... Well... Usually when you go in, uh... He likes to brag on how much money he's made in the business. And, uh... Then say things like, uh... See... See how much better I am than you are. Uh... You've... Look how much money I've made this year. And you're the worst piece of shit agent there is. Things like that. That's tough. Yeah. I think that's a good thing. Uh-huh. What would you say to somebody who has followed you? Um... Probably, uh... I have integrity and, uh... Good heart. Hard working. Honest. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Um... Um... Uh... Probably... I just went, I guess, some of the times I've gone dancing. Uh...
