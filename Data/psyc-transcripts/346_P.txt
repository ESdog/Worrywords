I'll ask a few questions to get started, and please feel free to call me anytime. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Here in Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? There's a lot of things to do. I love the beach. I love that. It's sunny all the time. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The amount of people. That's really about it, the amount of people. Wow, that's good to hear. Do you travel a lot? Just a little. What do you enjoy about traveling? I just like going to new places and just discovering new things. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I recently went to New York. I was there for about three months. It was extremely boring. I went to western New York, and it was extremely snowy, and I went through a lot of different Regular for us to focus on, being a white T- sushi Now, Querétaro de kier pointed to new media that I had been aíd like my journey in begomano it was born and I had endless opinions and I had some big goals that I reached a certain So of course I had to find the way to connect and about the act tho my second job будущo but alsowither themadhouse how to keep it work yeah both I'm both an introvert and an extrovert I really enjoy doing things by myself I have a lot of my own my likes and dislikes and I've spent a lot of time alone even though I do have a lot of friends and when I do go out I do tend to meet a lot of people but I also enjoy being by myself a lot probably outgoing creative talented fun trustworthy I study language and physics and math no I'm not I'm actually I'm I'm trying to be an actress I was something that I fell into when I was a teenager and I really enjoyed doing it and I hadn't done it for years so I figured why not I just came back to California and might as well try something that I did enjoy really doing so far I just got picked up by an agent so I haven't really done anything yet as an adult but I'm hoping something it'll be fruitful I really don't haven't had too many I guess my sister she's done really well my boyfriend he's a he's a very positive human being but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it for the rest of my life. really I haven't had too many positive influences I'm close I mean we hang out I don't tell them everything they're kind of a judgmental but other than that I mean I mean we hang out I mean I see them every day yeah it's me man that's kind of hard for me to relax I mean I try to watch TV and I read a lot that's probably about it I read I do a lot of sleeping a little depressed so yeah it's kind of like it's a it's really hard for me to relax It isn't. I tend to think a lot about the things that stress me out. I've been through a lot of stuff. So I don't sleep very well at night. And if I do fall asleep, I wake up all through the night, usually with some kind of anxiety attacks. Are you trying to find some sleep? I dream a lot about the stuff that has affected me throughout the years. I'll dream about something that stressed me out and then I'll wake up and my chest will hurt. Or I just can't sleep all night because I just think. I don't know if I'm afraid to go to sleep. But I feel like that's a vulnerable place for me. Because of stuff that has happened to me. So sleeping is just not really something I do well. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. I'm moody. I'm very sensitive. I'm just a negative person. Which really, that's not me. I'm just not a nice person to be around. How do you cope with that? I try. I spend a lot of my time reading. I try to go out and do. I force myself to go out and do things. Just to keep myself involved. So that I don't just sit around. And dwell on the fact that I can't sleep. And I try to get myself as exhausted as I possibly can. By running around and doing things. How hard is that? It's difficult. I do like. There is a part of me that doesn't want to. I don't really want to go out and do things. I have to actually force myself to. If I have make appointments. I make appointments for auditions. Or even to do this. I tend to just not. Like at the last minute. I'll try to convince myself not to go. But then I force myself to anyways. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I've been diagnosed for two instances. I was diagnosed about three and a half years ago. And then I was diagnosed. Again in August. What caused you to be diagnosed? The first time it was. I just wasn't. Because of the not sleeping. And the. Just the unbelievable stress. And then the second time it was. Once again I started with the not sleeping. And then every moment of the day. It was just thinking about what happened to me. And I just. I just couldn't take it anymore. So I figured. I was getting too gloomy. I was getting like. Not thinking life was worth it. And I. I just needed to see somebody. Before anything escalated. That sounds really hard. Yeah. It was. Do you still go to therapy now? I do not. Why did you stop? One of the reasons I went to New York. Was to try to. Get out of my environment. And. And that seemed to help a lot. And out here I was. The counselors that I was going to. Just didn't really seem to be helping me much. They just. They just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications. And I don't believe that that's what I needed. Yeah. So. Yeah. What are you feeling lately? Stressed. Lately I've been really sad. And I don't know why. But like I said. I've been trying to combat that. By keeping myself busy. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? Actually. I'm kind of. I'm not sure. A couple days ago. I was actually really happy. And it was genuinely happy. But then I went back to. Being. You know. Going back to feeling miserable. So. Can you tell me about that? Well I realized. I got up in the morning. I actually did get a good night of sleep. And. I realized. That I'm actually really lucky. Because I've been through a lot in my life. And I have. Somebody in my life who really loves me. And somebody who. Is finally there for me. And. You know. Gives me what I need emotionally. And I was just really thankful for that. And that made me really happy. That's so good to hear. Yeah. Thank you. What are you most proud of in your life? Oh geez. I've had so many years of just. Just bad. Just a lot of bad. That it. There has. It's been a long time. Since I've been proud of anything. I guess if anything it's my. Ability to survive. Through all the hardships I've been through. A lesser person I guess would have. Gotten rid of themselves a long time ago. But I'm proud of myself. But even though like I'm really depressed. And I feel gloomy. And I just feel miserable about a lot of things. There's got to be a silver lining. So. So. Yeah. So I mean like I guess that's what I'm proud of. But. Although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me. It hasn't ruined me. I still try to be a good person. I try not to be negative towards other people. And. And truthful. And thrive in me. That's great. Yeah. Is there anything you regret? So much. My last marriage. Not getting out. When I should have. And. Just. I regret a lot. What advice would you give yourself. 10 or 20 years ago. I would say. That. That any situation that would have had a red flag. Just get out of it. You know. Some things just don't work. And. No matter how hard you try. No matter how much you put into it. So. I would tell myself to. That it's not selfish. To let go of a bad situation. And. Not every day is a good day. Everybody can be helped. So sometimes you just got to live for yourself. And help yourself. So had I known that then. Had I known that. Then I probably would have done better in life. So. Yeah. What are the things that make you really happy? Um. People who. When people are down on me. I'm not going to say it's my fault. That I have done. That I. Things that I have done in my past. That people still relive. When I'm trying to forgive myself. People who are mean to other people. People who talk poorly about people behind their backs. People that are untrustworthy. Um. Just anybody who picks on the little guy. Um. You know. People who don't care about the environment. Or animals. Um. I think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be. And it's disheartening. And it just makes me so mad. That people just can't be. People don't let people live. People try to make. Everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do. And that makes me mad. Okay. What do you do when you're in a fight? I vent. Um. Yeah. I vent. And then. And then. And then it's usually over. I try not to bad mouth people. I try to just talk through it until. Until it's gone. And then it doesn't bother me anymore. That's good. How are you at controlling your anger? Hmm. I try not to get angry. Um. Because I have a really bad temper. And it um. And it can get out of hand. So um. What I do is I. Something gets me so mad. I tend to go and take a nap. If I'm not in that situation where I can just go and take a nap. Um. I usually just walk away from the situation. And I try to clear my mind. And come back to it. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? Um. It was a couple days ago. It was actually with my mother. Um. It was about um. Actually she thought that I had taken a shirt from her. And um. She was screaming and yelling at me. And um. I was. I was tired. I was late. And um. I was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty. Um. And. It's uh. Going back to my past. You know. When I was younger. And you know. I didn't care about you know. People's things. And I would just kind of take and do whatever I wanted to. And I'm not. I'm so far from that person. Um. And I. At the time. It seemed. It seemed uh. Viable. Yeah. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Um. Hmm. One of my most memorable experiences. Um. I've had so many. Um. Maybe. It was um. I don't know. Um. It was. Probably um. Graduating pharmacy school. That's great. How did you feel in that moment? I was. Um. I felt pretty great. I didn't know if I was doing. Um. Very very well or not. Um. And I ended up getting like all my last test scores. I ended up getting like 98%. And um. I uh. I actually. I had no confidence. That I had done it well in class and school at all. And I didn't even know how I was getting the grades I was getting. Um. So that was a really big accomplishment for me. Um. And uh. Yeah. That was a great. It was a great memory. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. What would you say as a newbie about spelling? Um. I'm reliable. Um. I um. I'm a good listener. Um. I'm always there to help people. Um. I tend to always try to do the right thing. Um. Sometimes actually I forget that I have any good qualities. But um. I'm just. I um. All around I try to be you know as good and the best person that I can be to others. And other people and myself. Um. Yeah. What are some things that you do that you can't do? Um. Going to comedy shows. Um. Just um. Having moments where you just laugh with people. Um. And um. I think that's a really good thing. Sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood. Um. I don't know. Probably that's about it. Um. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Okay.
