Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious about the people in the state of Missouri and Maryland. I'm not a therapist, but I'm really learning about people and I love learning about you. I'll ask a few questions, but I'll start. And please feel free to send me a message. Your answers are a tremendous help to me. Are you a therapist? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. Kind of. Good. Yeah. Where are you from and where are you from? Los Angeles. Really? Yes. What's the thing you really like about LA? The thing I like about LA? The weather. It's not easy to meet people. Can you tell me about that? Well, it just feels like people aren't out very much. They're like that movie in Crash where people are just in their cars all the time. It feels like that. Yeah. I see you in. I'm in the middle of a movie. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No. Not too much. Okay. What's your subject at school? Child development. How did you decide to do that? Well, I have a son and I wanted to know how to be a good mom. And so I wanted to know how to be a good mom. And so I wanted to know how to be a good mom. Newerое мое .ee I've been really blessed that me and my husband have quite an amenity for two things we do and that we switch up practices while we're going out to play. Newer ee I'd like to write. Nice. Tell me about that. Well, I've written some children's books, and I've just been doing research, looking into getting my books published. There's only, like, two that I've written so far, but they're pretty good. I've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups. It's about a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks, and he tries to not become a jerk with them. And it puts him in, like, a really... He goes through a lot of moods, dealing with the people in his life. Awesome. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. I've had some issues, some nervous breakdowns, actually. And right now, my son is staying with his dad, so... No, I'm a single mom. It was the hardest thing. The hardest thing, I think, in the world is being a single mom. How do you cope with that? How do I cope? Yeah. Well, right now... I didn't have very many coping skills or mechanisms, so... What's the best thing about being a parent? It's so spontaneous. Like, the stuff that comes out of kids' mouths sometimes, and the stuff that they do, and it just brings the smile to your face. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. Could you share a little bit? well when my son was younger once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom I want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend so yeah pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kids telling me I need to not be single anymore the hardest thing not wanting to screw it up I feel a lot of stress and pressure and I'm like I don't want to do this that every little thing is going to make a difference and matter and what kind of person my kids turned out to be and so it's a lot of stress on yourself yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely I think I'm different from my mom because I'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction I welcome it you know I welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that I want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they one thing down the stairs is that you want them to test out instead of a� at renowned athlete 👎 👎 👎 👎 👎 👎 👎 👎 👎 👎 👎 frog 👎 👎 👎 👎 L 👎 👎 Okay. Well, I've tried to meditate sometimes. But I don't really stick with it often enough. I've tried to, like, go for walks. But I don't always do that. And I don't always stick with it. So. Yeah. That's about it. I say I'm a little below average, meaning that I get angry more than most people do, I think. Hmm. Last night, it was on the telephone. I was arguing with my husband. We have my sister lives with us. And she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment, I should say. And she's got four people living in one room. So it's kind of stressful. It's really crowded. And my husband is stressed out about it. And, you know, I'm just saying to him that I told you so. I told you if my sister moved in here, then there was going to be a mess in the house. And she's going to be asking for things she don't really want to do. That's just how my sister is. So the house is messy and it's crowded. And every day they're asking for rides. And my husband, he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home. And he doesn't want to be there anymore. And I'm just saying that he's going to have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it, in my opinion. Yeah. So. It does. Oh, I've got tons of them. But right now, that's all my mind is losing custody of my son. Right now, like, I've been arguing with my stepmom. And my stepmom. And my step sister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how I want him to be treated. Like, they don't have any boundaries. And I believe that boundaries are important. Establishing who's the adult, who's the child. They let my child boss them around and stuff. Anyways, because of this, they're going to be testifying against me in the custody trial. Saying that. Yeah. They're saying that I'm not a good mom. Because I believe in having boundaries. And we have very different ideas about child raising. She's my stepmom. She's my dad's fifth wife. And she's. She really doesn't. She's really far removed from how I was raised. And I want to raise my child more similar to how I was raised. Where we had some independence and we had some boundaries. And we knew. What the rules were and what was expected of us. And with my stepmom, she wants no rules. She has no expectations. She just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants. And that's fine when you're a grandparent. But the problem is that I live with them sometimes. And when I'm in the same house with them, they should be following my rules. And not trying to go and break all of my rules. Anyway. Yeah. How did you feel about them? In that moment. Just really frustrated because they don't listen to me. I feel. Disrespected. I feel like invisible. I feel. I feel. Just angry. That they're taking away my right to parent. And it's something that I worked really hard to do. I went to school and I studied child development. I read all the magazines and I read the books. And I really. I know what I'm talking about. I feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities. And. To have these people that haven't done the same thing. And worked as hard as I have to be a good parent. Try and tell me that I'm a bad parent. It's really. Hard to believe. So I feel very disrespected. And. Unacknowledged. Angry. Frustrated. All those things. How easy is it for you to get a good next week? I'm. I'm. I take. I take Benadryl to help me sleep. And I'm. So. My doctor gave me that. Gave me Benadryl. Told me I could take it to help me sleep. And last night I was crying. Before I went to sleep. So. Sometimes these thoughts start. Running through your head at night. When you're in bed. But. I tried to push them out. And then I got up and I took my Benadryl. So I could go to sleep more easily. Are you triggered by something? Yeah. I'm always thinking about my son. How I wish he was with me. And how unfair everything is that's happening. And I get to. I don't deserve. To have my son taken from me. Because I'm a really good mom. You know. And I'm too hard on myself. So. But. I am a good mom. And I feel confident that I'm a good mom. Which is. I don't really have the money. To take care of my son. Like my dad. The son's dad does. And I'm. He has more money than me. And right now. I'm trying to be okay with it because. I know he can do more for him. Financially than I could. That doesn't mean I'm not a good mom. Hmm. How do you feel about me? I'm pretty depressed. I'm on antidepressants. Um. I'm trying to figure out. I take Wellbutrin. I've been on them for a couple weeks now. I think they're working. I don't know. I'm not as down as I was. I mean, I got here today. I got dressed. I made it out, and I'm here today. So it's not that bad. What got you into the company? Hmm. Hmm. My husband complains a lot. He says I'm not the same person that I was when he married me. He said I was fun, and I was positive, and I was all these other optimistic things. That's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night. And I'm not those things anymore. Which is true. I mean, we got married a year ago. And then my son was taken shortly after, and it was just such a shock. And I've just been trying to get back from it. But it's been hard. Hi, Mr. Did you think you had a problem with the way you found out? Did I think I had a problem? I had a problem before I found out. Found out what? Oh. Yeah, I like crying a lot. Sometimes I cry all the time. It doesn't take much for me to cry. I'm just crying thinking about crying. But, like, my family would invite me to family events. And I would go and just. Just cry because my son wasn't there. Or, um. I don't know. It's just all the crying, I think. And, like I said, my husband letting me know that I'm not the same person. So, he's disappointed. And I feel bad even that. I'm not the same person that he knew. I feel bad about that too. It's another thing I'm feeling bad about. You know? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . yeah I do I try do I feel like the therapy is useful um yeah it's nice to talk about your problems I go in there and I cry every week so at least I have a set time every week where I can go in and cry um that's I mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes I feel better afterwards um yeah and she helps me make decisions you know helped me to be more proactive in my life um well I'm looking for jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here why don't you work there have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about why don't you go back to school and so I went and applied to go back to school you know I'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either so I'm trying to find a and I applied for college in the fall I got accepted to Dominguez Hills so I may be going back to school in the fall right now I'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kind of stuff just giving me ideas that life isn't over there's still more you know I could be doing this life life yeah um um um
