Right. There you go. There you go. Okay. Yep. Yes. Pretty good. Pretty good. I had a good morning, a good productive day. Did some work with some kids at a basketball camp, so. New York. What are some things you really like about your life? I don't know. Well. What do I like about. What do you enjoy about traveling? What do I enjoy about traveling? Meeting new people. Kind of having that experience of being in the moment all the time because everything is so new. And just kind of getting my routine shaken up a little bit temporarily. Really. What are some of the best things you've done? One of my trips? Probably. The best one maybe was when I went to Costa Rica with like seven or eight other friends. And then four of us went on to go to Guatemala. I mean, I'm sorry. Panama. To an island off Panama. Panama. It was amazing. It was just a total new world. Totally new cultures. Off the beaten path. It was nothing I'd ever seen before. So. It opened up my eyes to the world a little bit. Probably. Probably. I studied theater and politics and music. What do you do now? Right now I am deciding or figuring out if I'm going to be doing basketball as a career or if I'm going to be doing IT. Networking type stuff as a career. Okay. What's your dream job? Hmm. Do you think you'll be a child or a boy? Kind of depends. Probably. Probably. I'm 65% shy and 35% outgoing. Why? I don't know. I think I just like to kind of take things slow and get to know someone a little bit first before I open up to them. Yeah. Yeah. But sometimes I'm just in a real gregarious mood. It just kind of flows out of me. And I'm just like talking to everyone. But usually I kind of hang back a little bit and get a feel for a person before I open up to them. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Oh. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the system's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best day of God. What do you do in your life? Meditate now is tremendously helpful. Play hoops, I write, I go to a journal. And I talk to someone that I care about, that I know that I love them. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm fine. I can explain jokes. I practice with my teacher. I have email disturbed everyday.� 본� geç пар 료 � Legion is my strong position. All the time, I'm playing Sure do. federal. Okay. Thank you. Let's see. built up and I didn't express them so it eventually led to like erratic behavior because it kind of came out and like spurts or like bursts and a bunch of stuff was like unleashed at once instead of you know normally something happens it gets released in this case when something got released it was like a hundred things got released at once because they'd all been saved up when was the last time you argued with someone you remember now? tell me more about that uh the last time I argued with someone was probably with tell me about a situation that you wish you remembered differently uh when I I broke up with my girlfriend before I was deployed overseas yeah I didn't um that the way I handled that I kinda just laughed and pretended not to care any more and um She didn't deserve that, and her family didn't deserve that. They've been pretty good to me. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. I don't know. I don't wish I could erase. How old were you when you got married? How old were you when you got married? How did you decide to move to New York? I didn't really want to go to college, so why not? Serve my country? Yes, all in all, yes. It was tough, but I needed to get that dose of reality. It was good. It was kind of a pretty drastic change from, like I wish there had been more of a gradual increase in the intensity of the experience. I got a little overwhelmed at times, but it made me stronger in the end. Yes. How easy was it for you to get out of college? It took me, I mean it took me, you know, let's say like a few, maybe five or seven years to completely kind of assimilate my experience. But only like, I mean the first six months after I got out of the army was a little strange. I kind of just did nothing because everything had been so structured. For so long that I was just like, I'm living on my own schedule. I'm not doing anything. And yeah, and then, you know, I was, it took me some time after that just to kind of figure out what I wanted to do in life. What did you do after you moved there? I went back to school. And, or went, I mean, yeah, went to college for the first time. Started playing basketball again for college. And basically kept that up. Last couple years I just started coaching basketball and doing some computer training. Learning how to play. And, excuse me, learning how to do networks, computer networking. And that's it. Now I'm right here. Now I'm writing a book on what I've learned. So, overall, really good. Really, really free. Like I'm creating my own future now for the first time in a long, long time. That's great. Yeah, yeah. It's been a little bit. But what's the word? Like, you know, on the edge. Or, like, you know, not like since. I mean, the biggest thing that changed my behavior was starting to meditate. For sure. So I did that for the first time about three years ago. And that pretty much brought me back to myself. Kind of like, you know, what I consider to be kind of my true self. So that definitely changed my behavior. Now I'm acting more from my heart instead of, like, reacting to, like, my thoughts. About the past or the future. Nine times out of ten, I sleep pretty great. When I don't sleep well, it's pretty clear. I'm pretty quiet. I kind of keep to myself. I don't have that, like, sparkle. I don't have that, like, that, like, attack energy. You know, that energy to go out and get it. That's kind of how I'm feeling right now. A little bit tired. Didn't sleep that great last night. So I went to bed late. Normally I go to bed, like, 9, 10 o'clock. Last night I went to bed at, like, probably, like, 1 o'clock. And I was hoping for a move. So. Yeah, today I'm feeling, I'm a little bit, like, blah. Yeah. I'm not really. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. No, I've never been diagnosed. I went through a period where the first two or three years after I was in the army, I kind of wanted life to be the way it was before I had joined the army. The world seemed a lot simpler then to me and a lot more manageable. And then I got hurt while I was playing basketball and I couldn't play hoops for a while for like two years. And I'd say like I was pretty down during that period, but I was always, I had one foot in the down. The down. The down zone. But my other foot was in like how do I get myself out of this predicament? Like I never like gave up hope. I mean, there's flashes, like thoughts will flash like every one long once in a while where it's like, what's the point? You know, like I'm going to just die at the end anyways. So why fight? You know, why struggle? But in general, no, it's 99.999% of the time. You know, go deep inside and find out what the right thing to do is and then do it the best I can. Well, I was, I mean, I was pretty happy last night when I saw my old girlfriend and I got to like spend quality time with her and just kind of like give her love and like not make it all about something physical. And I was pretty happy when I first got into LA a week ago and I made it to Venice and I was playing hoops and it was pretty good. It was sunny. I was beautiful. I was free. I had my car. I had no agenda. I had money in the bank. When was the last time I was like ecstatically happy? That's tough. Probably, you know, probably when I went on that trip to, well, there was a moment. About two years ago, me, my brother and my sister went on a trip together to the Dominican Republic. That was, um. That's great. Who's some of the girls that you've met? Um. Definitely the. Tell me about that. Definitely, yeah, the girl that was. My first love, like she was a great person. She had a really, really good heart. And I kind of. My best friend probably thinks that like, you know, I'm. Um. This like funny, cool guy. That's like going to be a movie star someday or something. And, um. Like take everyone on like trips and like. Just like make everything fun for everyone else. That's great. How about something that is. Yeah, um. I mean you might think that you've ever. Um. twent. My. Were going. I played yesterday against a bunch of guys and it was just great. It was just magical. I love it. I love the people. I love the craziness that comes through there. People on bikes with boom boxes. People in clown suits. People friggin' just doing all kinds of stupid stuff in the background. People on the boardwalk walking by checking it all out. All those people running around making things interesting and playing basketball amidst all of that. It was great. Yeah. You're welcome. Goodbye. Adios.
