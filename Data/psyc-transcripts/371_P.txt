Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I've been created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good, thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in the San Fernando Valley in California. Really? Really. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the beaches. I like there's just many things to do. And you can't beat the weather. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic, cost of living. Okay. And some of the things great about LA. Have youwalked? Nothing. I haven't. I've only been out of the country once. Or a few times, actually. But only to one other country. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Well, they were when I was younger, before I turned 21, and we used to go to Tijuana across the border just to get into nightclubs and stuff like that. What do you enjoy about traveling? Well, I love to see new things, new places, and have new experiences. Cool. What did you study at school? After high school, I went to beauty school for cosmetology. How did you decide to do that? Well, at the time, I was looking for a career change, and I was looking for a job. I have some friends in the industry, and I decided to take classes and see what I thought. Are you still doing that? Only as a hobby. What's your dream job? Well, that's a tough one to answer. I'd have to think about that. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I would be on the outgoing side. Why? Just because I'm more outgoing than I am shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank's green saver. Hey, I know you're a fish tank. I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? A lot of times I smoke marijuana. Cool. How are you at controlling your temper? Not the best. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? I had an argument with my mother over how we should handle doing things with my grandmother. Can you tell me about that? Well, we just had differences on who should do what at what times and who's in control. I should pretty much let her follow her rules because she's her daughter. How did you feel in that moment? Well, it's okay. I understood. We talked it out and realized that I might have been overstepping my bounds. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's fairly good. I am pretty close with my mom and my grandmother. I have a stepfather and a half-brother. We get along okay, but we're not very close. And I've never met my real father. Uh-huh. What's something you feel guilty about? Um... Maybe not accomplishing as much as I should have in my life up to now. Have you done anything to avoid it? Uh, yeah, maybe... By not having enough ambition or drive to be in a better position in my life. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Uh... Well, one of the hardest decisions was when I moved away from Los Angeles to Wisconsin. Tell me more about that. Well, when I was younger, I was getting in trouble and I was looking for a way out so I wouldn't continue getting into trouble. And I... With a friend, we just packed our bags and moved to Milwaukee. Wow. Are you happy you did that? Yes. Wow. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh... Extremely difficult. Why? I guess, uh... I got a lot of things going on... Or not going on. And it just makes it hard for me to sleep. Like what? Um... Issues in my life. And, uh... Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Sure. Sometimes. I'm not sure. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um... I guess it depends on what I have to do. Do you feel down? Right now? Uh-huh. A little. Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Well, in the last few minutes since we started talking about depressing stuff. I'm starting to feel a little more down. I'm sorry. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I haven't. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Um... Very seldom. How do you cope with them? Just stop thinking about them. Um... Are you triggered by something? I don't know. I couldn't answer that right now. Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um... I... I don't know. I guess I felt, it's been a while since I've been really happy. I don't have a whole lot of very happy thoughts as recently. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, let's see. I did go to Las Vegas a couple months ago. I had a good time there. That's good. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Well, I'm an honest person. For the most part, reliable. I think I'm easy to get along with. Tell me about an event. Or, something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Wow, where do I start? I have plenty of bad decisions I could erase. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah, well, I have a DUI on my record. How hard is that? Uh, well, for the time it's suspended my license, it makes life extremely difficult. Can you tell me about that? Well, yeah. It's hard to get around when you can't drive legally. And if you do drive illegally, you're at risk of going to jail. For driving with a license. Without a license. Has that gotten you in trouble? Uh, well, the original charge did, but I haven't got caught driving since. Okay. How would your best friend have grabbed you? I don't have a best friend. Oh, I see. I see. What are your most proud of in your life? Well, let's come back to that one. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Mmm, maybe that I could follow through with some of my plans. Be a little more ambitious. Maybe not. Some of the decisions I've made in my life I have regrets. Take care of business first and always handle your responsibilities. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Good weather, good music, good company, good conversation. What are you most proud of in your life? Wow, I don't have an answer for you. Okay. What are some things you like to do for fun? I love to bike ride. I can go for walks or hikes. I love to swim in the ocean. That's great. What's been a positive influence in your life? My mom. Can you tell me about that? She was a single mom with two kids and worked really hard to raise us. That sounds really hard. Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't easy. How close are you to them? Very. That's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. I have to go. Okay. All right. Bye. Thank you.
