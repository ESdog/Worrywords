Oh, I'm so... Okay. Okay. Yes. Kind of down. I don't have a boyfriend. I don't have my money. Florida. Yep. Try to find work. About once a year. More boring. How easy was it for you to get used to living in L.A.? Not easy. Can you tell me about that? It's hard when you don't have enough much money to get you a place so I have to live with roommates. Yeah. What are some things you really like about L.A.? The weather. The scenery. What are some things you don't really like about L.A.? Um. Traffic and it's too expensive to have your own place by your own. I can't even. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I want to. What do you enjoy about traveling? Um. Seeing different places. Different cultures. The buildings. The food and stuff. I must be good at all your trips. Um. Let's see. Okay. Um. I grew up in Florida over here. So. I guess that's probably. Um. I grew up in the south. I went to Alabama. Um. People are nice there. In Louisiana people are really nice. Mississippi. Then Texas. Then in Mexico. Then Arizona. Then here in California. I forgot. Sea. The country a little bit. Awesome. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess traveling through the country. I went to Louisiana. People are really nice. In a small town called Jennings. And people are always happy. You know. And fun. Funny. That's great. What did you study at school? Um. I just went to high school. That's it. The basic stuff. What's your favorite thing about school? What about your favorite job? I don't know. My dream job? I don't know. I don't know. An interior designer to the stars. Really? Yep. Why? Well, because if they have enough money to get their furniture I get to keep their free furniture too. And you have to come back to school. How about you? My favorite thing about school is that the kids are always happy. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the 15 screen savers. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV, funny TV shows. Like what? Sometimes Big Bang Theory or sometimes a funny movie. On TV. Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? Where I used to live about two weeks ago, I had to move out. And I moved in there and he told me that they didn't have any marijuana, marijuana plants. The only thing, I don't want to be around. And he said, I don't want to be around. And I had that, so I had to move out. Because he had his stuff in the living room. Yeah, he does. Yeah. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. I don't know. Good question. Probably. I don't know. Probably with my next boyfriend. We broke up. I don't know. Can you tell me about that? Yeah. That's in the past. I'm over him. He was a jerk anyway. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision? Leaving home? Yeah. Tell me about that. Well, I could try a better life out here in California, but I miss home. Yeah. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yep. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? My roommates don't have the, they don't have the, the, you know, the extra bed. TV on now, pretty good. Tired. I'm lazier during the day. I'm frustrated. I'm poor. I don't want to be. I'm just more sad. Nope. Wow. It's been like a while. It's been like, god, over two years. Um, I didn't have any money problems. I was doing fine. Um, yeah. Ah. What did I do? Um, I was with my cats at home here in California and they're playing outside. My ideal weekend would be nice. Um, at the beach, eating at a nice restaurant. No. No. No. Uh, no. I'm not going to go to any of these. Um, don't spend so much money. You don't need it in the future. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Save money. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Uh, my bank account. How would your best friend describe you? Um, like a nice person. You were very young, weren't you? I'm very what? What do you most proud of in your life? Um, I'm going to put that out now. You know, I persevere. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Ah, I'd rather not. What's some of the positive influence in your life? Um, yeah, a few years ago, it was more like a mentor and taught me some things. Yeah. Like what? Never complain. Be thankful for everything you have. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Um, my eyes. People say I have pretty eyes. Um, lucky dress up. What are two things you like to do for fun? For fun, I like to try surfing. Go shopping, maybe go to art galleries. That's good. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye.
