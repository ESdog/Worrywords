[00:00:00] SPEAKER_01: She's cute. Is she single?
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_01: She is.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_01: Hey.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_01: Oh, one caveat also.
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_01: Even if you try to ask her out on a date,
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_01: she's not sophisticated enough to respond back to your questions yet.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_01: That's all right. A lot of my dates aren't.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_01: That's never stopped me before.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_01: All right, so I'm going to go ahead and start the hand quarter.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_02: And this is going to start here.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_02: Okay, so she's going to ask you some questions.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_02: And then when she's done, she's going to say goodbye.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: And then you're going to press this button to let me know that you guys are done.
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_01: She's looking at me so flirtatiously.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_01: She nodded at you.
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so just a few caveats before we get started.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_01: We're working with technology here, and this is kind of a pilot project right now.
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_02: So there is a chance that some things are not going to go perfectly.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_02: So if there is a pause where Ellie doesn't say anything for about 10 to 15 seconds,
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_02: please press this button and let me know.
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_02: Because it's probably an indication that something is going wrong.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: There's also a chance that you're working with speech recognition technology,
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_02: which if you've ever used Siri on the iPhone, you know it's not perfect.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_02: So there's a chance that you may say something that she misunderstands.
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_02: And she might ask you some follow-up questions that don't pertain to what you just said.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_02: So just kind of bear with us.
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_02: Hopefully everything will go smoothly.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_02: But I had to give you some caveats before we got started.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_02: So again, just press this button once she says goodbye.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_04: Yep.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_04: Okay.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_04: So, how are you doing today?
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_04: Okay.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_04: How are you?
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_04: That's great.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_04: Where are you from originally?
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_04: Switzerland.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_04: Switzerland.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_05: What are some things you really like about L.A.?
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_05: Do you travel a lot?

[00:03:01] SPEAKER_03: Sales.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_03: What's your dream job?
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_03: Acting.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_03: Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_03: Both.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_01: Tell me about your relationship with your family.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver.
