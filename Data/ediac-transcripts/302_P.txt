[00:00:00] SPEAKER_02: So you can just move around a little bit when you set the Xbox to connect to another screen.
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_02: There we go! Perfect.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_01: When you're finished, you can go ahead and ring this doorbell.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_01: Yep, one minute, one minute. She's done.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_01: Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_01: Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_01: I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you.
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_01: I'll ask a few questions to get us started.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_01: And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_01: How are you?
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_01: How are you doing today?
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_01: I'm fine. How about yourself?
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_01: That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally?
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm from Los Angeles, California.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: Really? Me too.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_00: What part?
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_00: Why don't we talk about it a little later?
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_00: What are some things you really like about LA?
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_00: All my family's here. Friends.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_00: A mixture of people and a lot of things to do.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_00: Okay. What did you study at school?
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_00: Early childhood education.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_00: Nice. Are you still working in that?
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_00: No, not right now, but I would love to get back into it.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_00: I love working with kids, seeing them smile.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_00: Tell me more about that.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_00: I guess it goes back to when I was a kid. I liked being happy and playful, so I guess it just transferred to my adult life.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: What's your dream job?
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: Working with kids as a school teacher or in that capacity.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: That sounds really hard.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is, but if it's a passion of yours, it would always be fun.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: That's great. How close are you to your family?
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: Very close. Sometimes too close.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: Can you give me an example of that?
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_00: I have four sisters and one brother on my mom's side.
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_00: And on my dad's, I have six.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_00: Six brothers and four sisters.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_00: And we're all intertwined together, so that's why I say we're too close sometimes.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: I see what you mean.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_00: Do you consider yourself an introvert?
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: I have a lot of friends that I interact with, and we're always doing different things, so that's why I say I'm not.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: What do you do when you're annoyed?
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_00: Curse.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: Just let it out.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_00: Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: A couple days ago. My nephew.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: Didn't call me back.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_00: How did you feel in that moment?
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_00: Uh, kind of mad, because I had set aside some time to spend with him, and he just blew it off and didn't call me back.
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. That sucks.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_00: Mm, I'm okay.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_00: Okay. Hmm. What's one of your most memorable experiences?
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: When my mother passed.
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry. Tell me more about that.
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: Uh, it's been about...
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: Five years now to the day.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: So, it's getting better. Time makes it easier.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_00: Do you feel down?
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_00: A lot, because there's a lot of things that make me think about her on a daily basis.
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_00: Like what?
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_00: Anything. Uh, driving by a particular restaurant that she likes, uh, watching different TV shows. Just anything that could trigger a memory of my mom.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. When was the last time that happened?
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: Yesterday.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: I think I was in the same place as her.
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: Hmm. How do you cope with that?
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_00: Uh, think about the good times, and don't stay in that place too long. Just go ahead and think about it and move on.
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_00: Hmm, not officially, but I think I might be depressed.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_00: Tell me more about that.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: Well, I mean, since my mom passed, it's been kind of rough. And then, um, job situation's not stable here in California, so that has a lot to do with it as well, so...
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_00: That sounds really hard.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is, but...
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever seen any changes in her behavior or thoughts lately?
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_00: Kind of, sort of. Kind of just to myself. Reserve.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm. Do you have disturbing thoughts?
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_01: Not really.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_01: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_01: It's pretty easy.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: Grumpy, irritable, fidgety, some big ball of nerves.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: Do you travel a lot?
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: Uh, what do you mean?
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_00: Whatever comes to your mind.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: Uh, I guess so, yeah. I like to travel.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_00: What do you enjoy about traveling?
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: Meeting new people, different locations, scenery, uh, different opportunities to try something new.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_00: Awesome.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: I'd love to hear about your trips.
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_00: Uh, I just came back from Memphis about three weeks ago.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_00: Going to see family and friends.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_00: Uh, it was pretty nice.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: Got a chance to see, uh, something new.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: Change?
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: Change in your life.
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: Change the scenery?
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_00: What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_00: Wow.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_00: Stick to the plan and don't veer off to the left or right. Just go straight ahead.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_00: What made you decide to do that?
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_00: Uh, I don't know.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_00: Just different circumstances in life that gradually pushed me towards the left and the right.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: There are always tradeoffs in life, aren't there?
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_00: Every day.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_00: Is there anything you regret?
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: Uh, a few relationships. Not staying in school.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_00: Uh.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_00: Missing out on great opportunities with employers.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_00: How would your best friend describe you?
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_00: Uh, funny, loyal, spontaneous, life of the party.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh.
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_00: How do you know them?
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_00: Grew up together in the same community.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: Went to school together. High school friends.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_00: Uh, my big sister, Michelle.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_00: Uh, my friend, Troy.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_00: Uh.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_00: I mean, there's others, but those two, no matter good or bad, they're always in my corner for me.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. That's so good to hear.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.

[00:11:07] SPEAKER_00: Oh. That's great. I'd love to hear all about it.
