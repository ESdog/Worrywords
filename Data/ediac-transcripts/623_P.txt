[00:03:25] SPEAKER_02: What are some things you really like about LA?
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_02: I'm from Macon, Georgia.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_02: I like the city.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_02: I sometimes like the fast-paced of it.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_02: I like the weather, the beaches, and I like the opportunities that you have here versus
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_02: any other cities that I've lived in.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_02: So I love the weather.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_02: It's a nice city to live in.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_02: What are some things you don't really like about LA?
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: I like the city.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_02: Traffic.
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_02: Traffic and the property here is very expensive.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_02: It's a pretty spread out city.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_02: It's hard to kind of get to things if you don't have a car.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_02: That makes it hard.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_02: And the transportation here is not as good.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_02: So those are just a few of the things that I don't like about LA.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_02: I see what you mean.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_02: I like the city.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_02: Do you travel a lot?
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_02: Not as much as I'd like to.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_02: What do you enjoy about traveling?
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_02: What I enjoy about traveling is boarding a plane and going somewhere that you possibly
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_02: never been before.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_02: I like the idea of where you're going.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_02: You may experience new things, meet new people.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: And just traveling.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: And just the overall fact of getting out of your environment.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_02: Sort of the rat race as I call it.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_02: I'd like to hear about one of your trips.
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_02: One of my trips has been such a long, long time ago.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_02: I went to Europe.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_02: Particularly I flew into Belgium.
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_02: That was a great experience.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_02: And I went to visit my brother.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: My brother that stayed in Belgium, Brussels.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_02: And I was over there for two weeks.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_02: I got to visit.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_02: I actually drove from Belgium to Germany.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_02: And drove from Berlin, Germany to Paris, France.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_02: So the experience was great.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_02: The people was great.
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_02: The night life was good.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_02: I had an enjoyable time in Europe.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_02: I really liked it.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_02: What's one of your most memorable experiences?
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_02: Could you repeat that again?
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_02: What did you study at school?
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_02: Well, I didn't further my education in college.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_02: But I did finish high school.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_02: And some of the subjects that I liked when I was in high school was I loved American history.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_02: And I enjoyed science.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_02: Those were two of my top subjects when I was in high school.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_02: What do you do now?
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_02: Now I work in real estate.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_02: I work for a guy in real estate.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_02: And I find properties, old properties that has been abandoned by their owners or whoever that lived there.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_02: And if we can find the people, we offer them a contract on the property.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_02: Then once they agree to that, everybody signs off on it.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_02: Then we start to go in and rehabitat the place.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_02: Fix it up, clean it up, and turn around and sell it.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_02: And I put up advertising signs for the business also.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_02: So I'm involved a little bit into real estate.
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_02: What's your dream job?
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_02: I don't know if I have a dream job.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_02: But my success will lie on being financially successful.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_02: I want to be financially secure, which I find real estate can bring that once I start to achieve it.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_02: So I guess my dream job would be to have my own slew of properties throughout California.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_02: And possibly throughout some other states in our country.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_02: And just doing very well in real estate.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_02: Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_02: Outgoing.
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_02: Why?
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_02: Because I'm more open to people of different cultures.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_02: I love to talk.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_02: I love to engage in intellectual conversations.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_02: I like to debate.
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_02: Um. Um.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_02: Um.
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_02: I'm not shy.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_02: I'm very open to any topic, any subject that anyone wants to speak about or speak on.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_02: So I consider myself very outgoing.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about your relationship with your family.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_02: My relationship with my family is very good.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_02: My dad is deceased of about, hmm.

[00:09:28] SPEAKER_02: Four sisters, which still resides in Georgia.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_02: A brother that lives outside of Detroit.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_02: So that makes up my family.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_02: I contact them on a weekly basis via email or text.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_02: Or a phone call.
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_02: Very close.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_02: Very close Southern family.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_02: And I love them very much.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_02: Just don't get to see them as much as I'd like to.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_02: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_02: Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_02: What do you do to relax?
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_02: What I do?
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_02: What I do to relax is to connect with some close friends.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_02: Also, I found out if I go and work out or do my thing, it sort of relieves stress.
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_02: I like to work out.
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_02: So a lot of times I go and take the dog for a walk.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_02: Or I'll watch a nice comedy on television.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_02: So that's sort of how I get to relieve the stress in my life.
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_02: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_02: Very easy.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_02: I'm very hard to get upset.
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_02: So it's nothing to control there.
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_02: But when I do feel like there is a temper coming on,
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_02: I sort of think about something else to do.
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_02: Or just don't allow it to control me.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_02: I always think of something positive to do when I feel like my temper is starting to escalate.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_02: When was the last time you argued with someone?
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_02: What was it about?
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_02: The last time I argued with someone was just last night.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_02: My girlfriend.
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_02: It wasn't an argument, but she felt like I wasn't giving her enough attention.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_02: And I felt like I was giving her a lot of attention.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_02: So neither one of us was willing to give an inch.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_02: That's a trademark of Aquarius.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_02: So we sort of argued our way to sleep.
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_02: Not a big argument, but we just couldn't agree on it.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_02: What we wanted to get across to one another.
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_02: And it was basically about not enough time spent together.
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_02: Trying to think of a situation that I would handle differently...
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_02: What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_02: Um, something I feel guilty about is a divorce that I did.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_02: I went through about seven years ago.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_02: I should have thought it out a lot more than I did before I made the decision I did.
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_02: So...
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_02: I guess if that's the case, I guess that would be something that I wish I would have done different.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_02: The hardest decision I've ever had to make was, um...
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_02: Agreeing to go into the military.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_02: And I thought about it. I didn't want to do it.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_02: So, uh...
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_02: It was a really hard decision because...
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_02: I knew once I had agreed to do it...
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_02: To sign my name, then I was obligated to go.
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_02: So that was a very hard decision.
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_02: What else did you want to do?
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_02: I wanted to go to the military.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_02: I would love to do it.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_02: You were just a little kid.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_02: So, when was the last time you were in the military?
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_02: I was...
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_02: Twenty...
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_02: I believe I was 21.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_02: Between 21 and 22 years old.
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_02: How old were you when you joined the military?
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_02: I was...
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_02: I felt like, actually going back to that first question, I was about 19 years old when I joined the military.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_02: I felt good about it.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_02: It was something I thought about doing and I wanted to do it.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_02: I felt like it was becoming of a man back then to join the military.
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_02: And I thought good about it.
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_02: And as I look at it today, it really kind of set me up to the point that I'm in my life now with the discipline and the structure of your life and your family life.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_02: So it really kind of molded me into the person that I am now.
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_02: Are you happy with that?
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_02: Am I happy?
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_02: Did you ever see combat?
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_02: I went to the Gulf.
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_02: I went to the Gulf War in 1985.
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_02: I spent six months in the Gulf of Oman in 1985.
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_02: And that was a really...
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_02: Really tough experience right there for me.
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_02: Very hot, very dangerous, very hostile environment.
[00:16:14] SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_02: How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life?
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_02: It was really easy because after four years of serving in the military, I was done.
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_02: I was over it.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_02: I was ready to get back into it.
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_02: I was ready to go back to the civilian world and see what the civilian world had to offer me.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_02: And so far it's been good.
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_02: But I'm glad...
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_02: At the same time, I'm glad I had that military experience.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_02: You know, that military backing I have in my back pocket.
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_02: But I was ready for civilian life and it's been great.
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_02: What did you do after the military?
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_02: After the military, I worked for...
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_02: For about 14 years as a security officer.
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_02: Real nice job, good pay.
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_02: Unfortunate in 2005, my department was cut out due to the company not willing to negotiate our...
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_02: contract again.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_02: So after 14 years of that, I was let go.
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_02: Alright.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_02: How did serving in the military change you?
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_02: It made me more...
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_02: more rounded person.
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_02: It made me...
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_02: see things a little different in civilian life.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_02: It makes you a little bit sterner.
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_02: It makes you a little bit more disciplined than the regular...
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_02: soldier.
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_02: And it gives you a foundation.
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_02: How to go about your business in civilian life.
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_02: It's sort of...
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_02: To me, it just made you a better person all the way around.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_02: How to accept things and how to accept different peoples and different cultures.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_02: And it just made you open up with your...
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_02: your thinking process.
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_02: Alright.
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_00: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_02: Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_02: I've been feeling...
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_02: You know, pretty good lately.
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_02: You know...
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_02: Not as good as I want to feel.
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_02: But I've been...
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_02: I've been...
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_02: I've been feeling okay.
[00:19:12] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_02: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_02: Lately it's been a little bit hard because for some reason my neck...
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_02: have been tightening up on me.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_02: So, um...
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_02: It's been a little bit difficult to get...
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_02: a good night's sleep...
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_02: here over the last...
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_02: couple of weeks or so.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_02: There has been a lot going on.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_02: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_02: A little bit edgy.
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_02: A little bit...
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_02: Not attentive.
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_02: A little bit...
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_02: Uneasy.
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:19:58] SPEAKER_02: Those are some of the things that...
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_02: you know...
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_02: don't happen...
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_02: normally happens to me when I don't sleep well.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_02: Alright.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_02: Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_02: No, I haven't.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_02: Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_02: Um...
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_02: No, I haven't.
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_02: No, I haven't.
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:20:33] SPEAKER_02: When was the last time you felt really happy?
[00:20:38] SPEAKER_02: Hmm...
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_02: I guess I felt really happy...
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_02: when I was able to move away from my...
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_02: mother-in-law's house...
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_02: and move...
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_02: into my own house...
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_02: which was about four years ago.
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_02: And that made me really happy because...
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_02: me and my four kids...
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_02: and currently at the hospital...
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_02: At that time, my wife, we was all staying with my mother-in-law, in which we stayed
[00:21:06] SPEAKER_02: there for five years.
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_02: So I thought when we got our house, I was so happy because I could do what I want to
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_02: do.
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_02: I could move around as I wanted to and it just made me happy, made my family happy also.
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_02: That's great.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_02: Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_02: I would say my mother, of course, and my brother.
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_02: My mother, of course, because she's the one that brought me into this world.
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_02: And my brother is because I sort of see how he goes about his business and I sort of,
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_02: you know, I'm not sure.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_02: I sort of want to go down that same road as he's gone down.
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_02: So those are my two role models, as you would call it.
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_02: How would your best friend describe you?
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_02: Genuine, upbeat, friendly, positive.
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_02: Great.
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_02: Something I did recently that I really enjoyed.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_02: Nice.

==================================================
FULL TRANSCRIPTION:

 I'll let you know how I do. Alright. So I'm going to bring up the virtual human for a second. Okay. And then I'm going to shrink her back down and continue setting up. Oh, okay. There's my phone there. I'm going to turn that off. Okay. Sorry about that. No, it's fine. It gives you something to do. Yeah. It's basically just waving. So have you been here before? I've been on the other end somewhere else around here. I did a study. Did you like it? It was fine. It was good. It's good. So now I'm going to start the recording. Okay. Oh, this can help. Oh, it's on my ears? Yeah, this can hook around your ears. There we go. And that needs to go up. Okay. Okay. So she's going to ask you a series of questions. And when she's done, she should say, Goodbye. And then you can hit the doorbell again. Great. And if for any reason she stops talking for more than 10 to 15 seconds, it's something that could have gone wrong. Okay. And you should press the button. Oh, okay. If she stopped talking for like 10 to 15 seconds? Yeah. Okay. If she tells us for a long amount of time, basically. Oh, okay. Great. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people. I'm safe and secure and violent. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. I'm doing fine. Thank you. Where are you from originally? Macon, Georgia. Yeah, I'm from Macon, Georgia. All right. What are some things you really like about LA? I'm from Macon, Georgia. I like the city. I sometimes like the fast-paced of it. I like the weather, the beaches, and I like the opportunities that you have here versus any other cities that I've lived in. So I love the weather. It's a nice city to live in. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I like the city. Traffic. Traffic and the property here is very expensive. It's a pretty spread out city. It's hard to kind of get to things if you don't have a car. That makes it hard. And the transportation here is not as good. So those are just a few of the things that I don't like about LA. I see what you mean. Yeah. I like the city. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I'd like to. What do you enjoy about traveling? What I enjoy about traveling is boarding a plane and going somewhere that you possibly never been before. I like the idea of where you're going. You may experience new things, meet new people. And just traveling. And just the overall fact of getting out of your environment. Sort of the rat race as I call it. I'd like to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips has been such a long, long time ago. I went to Europe. Particularly I flew into Belgium. That was a great experience. And I went to visit my brother. My brother that stayed in Belgium, Brussels. And I was over there for two weeks. I got to visit. I actually drove from Belgium to Germany. And drove from Berlin, Germany to Paris, France. So the experience was great. The people was great. The night life was good. I had an enjoyable time in Europe. I really liked it. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Could you repeat that again? What did you study at school? Well, I didn't further my education in college. But I did finish high school. And some of the subjects that I liked when I was in high school was I loved American history. And I enjoyed science. Those were two of my top subjects when I was in high school. What do you do now? Now I work in real estate. I work for a guy in real estate. And I find properties, old properties that has been abandoned by their owners or whoever that lived there. And if we can find the people, we offer them a contract on the property. Then once they agree to that, everybody signs off on it. Then we start to go in and rehabitat the place. Fix it up, clean it up, and turn around and sell it. And I put up advertising signs for the business also. So I'm involved a little bit into real estate. What's your dream job? I don't know if I have a dream job. But my success will lie on being financially successful. I want to be financially secure, which I find real estate can bring that once I start to achieve it. So I guess my dream job would be to have my own slew of properties throughout California. And possibly throughout some other states in our country. And just doing very well in real estate. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. Why? Because I'm more open to people of different cultures. I love to talk. I love to engage in intellectual conversations. I like to debate. Um. Um. Um. I'm not shy. I'm very open to any topic, any subject that anyone wants to speak about or speak on. So I consider myself very outgoing. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family is very good. My dad is deceased of about, hmm. Maybe 11, 12 years now. My mother is still alive. She's lived back in Georgia. I believe she's 75 years old now. Four sisters, which still resides in Georgia. A brother that lives outside of Detroit. So that makes up my family. I contact them on a weekly basis via email or text. Or a phone call. Very close. Very close Southern family. And I love them very much. Just don't get to see them as much as I'd like to. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? What I do? What I do to relax is to connect with some close friends. Also, I found out if I go and work out or do my thing, it sort of relieves stress. I like to work out. So a lot of times I go and take the dog for a walk. Or I'll watch a nice comedy on television. So that's sort of how I get to relieve the stress in my life. How are you at controlling your temper? Very easy. I'm very hard to get upset. So it's nothing to control there. But when I do feel like there is a temper coming on, I sort of think about something else to do. Or just don't allow it to control me. I always think of something positive to do when I feel like my temper is starting to escalate. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? The last time I argued with someone was just last night. My girlfriend. It wasn't an argument, but she felt like I wasn't giving her enough attention. And I felt like I was giving her a lot of attention. So neither one of us was willing to give an inch. That's a trademark of Aquarius. So we sort of argued our way to sleep. Not a big argument, but we just couldn't agree on it. What we wanted to get across to one another. And it was basically about not enough time spent together. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um... Trying to think of a situation that I would handle differently... Um... What's something you feel guilty about? Um, something I feel guilty about is a divorce that I did. I went through about seven years ago. I should have thought it out a lot more than I did before I made the decision I did. So... I guess if that's the case, I guess that would be something that I wish I would have done different. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Um... The hardest decision I've ever had to make was, um... Agreeing to go into the military. And I thought about it. I didn't want to do it. So, uh... It was a really hard decision because... I knew once I had agreed to do it... To sign my name, then I was obligated to go. So that was a very hard decision. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Um... What else did you want to do? I wanted to go to the military. I would love to do it. You were just a little kid. So, when was the last time you were in the military? I was... Twenty... I believe I was 21. Between 21 and 22 years old. How old were you when you joined the military? Um... I was... I felt like, actually going back to that first question, I was about 19 years old when I joined the military. I felt good about it. It was something I thought about doing and I wanted to do it. I felt like it was becoming of a man back then to join the military. And I thought good about it. And as I look at it today, it really kind of set me up to the point that I'm in my life now with the discipline and the structure of your life and your family life. So it really kind of molded me into the person that I am now. Are you happy with that? Am I happy? Yes. All right. Did you ever see combat? I went to the Gulf. I went to the Gulf War in 1985. I spent six months in the Gulf of Oman in 1985. And that was a really... Really tough experience right there for me. Very hot, very dangerous, very hostile environment. I'm sorry. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? It was really easy because after four years of serving in the military, I was done. I was over it. I was ready to get back into it. I was ready to go back to the civilian world and see what the civilian world had to offer me. And so far it's been good. But I'm glad... At the same time, I'm glad I had that military experience. You know, that military backing I have in my back pocket. But I was ready for civilian life and it's been great. Thank you. What did you do after the military? After the military, I worked for... For about 14 years as a security officer. Real nice job, good pay. Unfortunate in 2005, my department was cut out due to the company not willing to negotiate our... contract again. So after 14 years of that, I was let go. Alright. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more... more rounded person. It made me... see things a little different in civilian life. It makes you a little bit sterner. It makes you a little bit more disciplined than the regular... soldier. And it gives you a foundation. How to go about your business in civilian life. It's sort of... To me, it just made you a better person all the way around. How to accept things and how to accept different peoples and different cultures. And it just made you open up with your... your thinking process. Alright. How have you been feeling lately? Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Um... I've been feeling... You know, pretty good lately. You know... Not as good as I want to feel. But I've been... I've been... I've been feeling okay. Um... How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Um... Lately it's been a little bit hard because for some reason my neck... have been tightening up on me. So, um... It's been a little bit difficult to get... a good night's sleep... here over the last... couple of weeks or so. There has been a lot going on. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um... A little bit edgy. A little bit... Um... Not attentive. A little bit... Um... Uneasy. Um... Those are some of the things that... you know... don't happen... normally happens to me when I don't sleep well. Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Um... No, I haven't. Um... Have you been diagnosed with depression? Um... No, I haven't. No, I haven't. When was the last time you felt really happy? Hmm... I guess I felt really happy... when I was able to move away from my... mother-in-law's house... and move... into my own house... which was about four years ago. And that made me really happy because... me and my four kids... and currently at the hospital... At that time, my wife, we was all staying with my mother-in-law, in which we stayed there for five years. So I thought when we got our house, I was so happy because I could do what I want to do. I could move around as I wanted to and it just made me happy, made my family happy also. That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I would say my mother, of course, and my brother. My mother, of course, because she's the one that brought me into this world.

Having my three kids. Having my three kids. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye.
