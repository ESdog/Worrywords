[00:00:00] SPEAKER_03: And now I'm going to bring up our virtual human just for a second here so you can see what she looks like.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_03: And then I'm going to shrink her back down as I continue setting everything up.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_03: I'm going to go ahead and put this behind you.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_03: And I'm going to look over your ears just like that.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_03: Perfect.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_03: It's the same one.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_03: Make sure this doesn't get in your way.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_03: There we go.

[00:00:23] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to shrink her back down and things are going to keep setting up here.
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_01: So just a couple of caveats before we get started.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_01: This is relatively new technology.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: So unfortunately, Ellie doesn't, she's our virtual human.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: She doesn't quite yet have the capability to answer questions.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_01: So she'll be the one asking all the questions today.
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_01: Also, you'll notice that she does pause sometimes here and there to listen to what you're saying.
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_00: If you notice a pause that's greater than about 10 seconds, I'd go ahead and press this button.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_00: You know, we're working with technology here.
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_00: Everyone can watch.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if something can go wrong.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_00: It's Friday already.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, maybe she'll get tired.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_00: Please.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_00: All right.
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_00: So if that happens, go ahead and press this button.

[00:01:09] SPEAKER_00: Okay, I'm going to start up the recording.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: And what's going to happen is she's going to ask you questions.
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_00: And then at the end, she'll say goodbye.
