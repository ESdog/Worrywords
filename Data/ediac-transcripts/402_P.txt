[00:00:52] SPEAKER_00: And ask her questions.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_00: And you said, if I don't want to answer, I can just say I don't want to answer.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to talk about that.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to talk about that.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_00: However you want to put it, she'll move on.

[00:01:08] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_00: Hi.
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_00: I'm Ellen.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_00: Thanks for coming in today.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_00: I'm a creative talk to people in the space and security environment.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_01: I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and to learn about you.
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_01: I'll ask if you'd like to.
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_00: Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_00: In 2006.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_00: How often do you go back to your hometown?
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_00: Never.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_00: I don't like it there.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_00: How does it compare to L.A.?
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: Oh, it's completely boring.
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_00: And there's very little to do.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: L.A. is preferable, I think, to most places.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: I see.
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_00: Why do you go to L.A.?
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: Because.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: I was.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: I was engaged to my fiance and we lived in Florida.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: I moved there to be with him and he loved the water, but I love the mountains and I
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: missed hiking and I didn't love Florida and he wasn't tied to it.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_00: So we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we could both be happy and also have more
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_00: opportunities and business and all of the great things that it has to offer.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: How about you?
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: What do you think about L.A.?
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_00: Very.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_00: Very easy.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_00: What do you think you really like about L.A.?
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: There's not much I don't like about L.A.
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_00: I love L.A.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: I think it feels magical.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_00: So many creative, different people of all ages, shapes, sizes, colors, races, the mountains,
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: the water.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: The city, all the things that there are to do, all of the different people there are
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_00: to meet.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: I just I love everything about L.A.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: That's so good to hear.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure you can tell them as well.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: I'm not much of a world explorer.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_00: Do you travel a lot?
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: I'd rather not talk about it.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_00: What do you study at school?
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: I'm a student.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: I didn't go to college.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_00: What's good for you now?
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: I'm still figuring that out.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_00: It may have something to do with animals.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_00: I have a dog that I really love, and I never had a dog as an adult.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_00: I had cats.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm a late bloomer.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_00: So I'm working on that whole process of trying to get my dog to have that kind of
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: conversation. I don't, I really don't want a job. I want a purposeful way to create wealth,
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_00: not just something to make money in the long run.
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_00: Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_00: It depends on the situation, but in general, I consider myself more shy, although most
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_00: people would consider me to be outgoing.
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the big pink screensaver. Hey, I know it's
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_00: I turn on classical music. Music, classical music if I'm especially stressed and play
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_00: with my dog, go for a walk.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_00: How do you do it controlling your hunger?
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm really good at controlling my hunger.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_00: I temper for the most part.
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you argued with someone?
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_00: And what was it about?
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_00: Before I came here.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: It was just about financial stress.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about a situation that you would see as a different one.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_00: Really personal.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_00: There's probably a lot of examples.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_00: Would you hand out your��.com to anybody with elderly children who has an issue such
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_00: as anxiety and depression, or even if they're an addiction vendo at a mental hospital?
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_00: I'd rather not talk about that either.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: I'd rather not talk about that.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: Not very easy at all.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: A lot better recently, but I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems, so it's challenging not to feel rested most of the time.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: In the past week, I've been feeling a lot better.
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_00: Yes, the weather has changed. Spring has sprung. It's a little warmer.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: I was having more trouble with my depression in the winter and I'm having trouble with tolerating cold.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: And so I wasn't doing a lot of the things that I normally do.
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: And I also was sick with the flu.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_00: And in the past week, I decided to go to the doctor.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_00: I was feeling better enough that I needed to get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that I need to do during the day.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_00: And walking my dog every day and not isolating so much.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_00: And seeing some of my friends more.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: So I've been feeling a lot better.
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_00: Like I've been making progress.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_00: And that in the past week, things have taken a more positive turn.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_00: That's great!
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been diagnosed with Dyslexia?
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: Have you been diagnosed with Dyslexia?
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_00: How long ago were you diagnosed?
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_00: It's been quite some time.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_00: Officially, it's probably been...
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: I don't know exactly.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_00: But let's see.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_00: Maybe more than 15 years ago.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: What got you into Dyslexia?
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_00: I was feeling suicidal.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: Do you still go to therapy now?
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_00: Why did you stop?
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_00: Because I found a better alternative.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_00: Why did you stop?
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_00: Tell me more about that.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_00: I've been in therapy off and on since I was 18.
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_00: And I've tried a variety of methods.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_00: And then I started working with a neuro-linguistic programmer.
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_00: And that was really the first person that helped me make permanent changes.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_00: And I was able to get off my anti-depressants as well.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_00: Even though I've struggled with some amounts of depression, it's never been anything extremely severe.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_00: And it was one of the best things that ever happened.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_00: How did you decide to do that?
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: Well, I was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: And I had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_00: And he was a doctor.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_00: And he was a doctor of that disease.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_00: And that was, he treats multiple issues.
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_00: And so everything is interrelated.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_00: So once I had my first conversation with him, I knew it was the right step for me.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_00: How did you clearly remember him?
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: I was so happy.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_00: I felt like I, some, I felt that I found the answer that I'd been looking for.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: That I hadn't given up hope.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: And I was happy.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_00: And that I was like on cloud nine.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_00: That I had been suffering for a long time.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_00: And I felt that I finally found the answer to the solution that I was looking for.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: It was like, it was the best thing I ever did in my life.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: It was the best decision I ever made.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: I felt extremely hopeful for the first time in a long time.
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_00: How did that show the music in your life?
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: Um, I went to, um, I went to a music store.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: Because, uh, I was so busy.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_00: I had been thinking about, um, taking up an instrument.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_00: I used to play the violin as a child.
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_00: And, uh, I've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side.
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_00: Because I felt it's been extremely repressed.
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_00: And, um, and so I went to the music store to try out, um, to see what it would feel like to, um,
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_00: to handle the instrument again.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_00: And see if I thought that that was something that I would want to pursue.
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_00: Awesome.
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_00: It was awesome.
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: How was it like studying on a real weekend?
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: Um, yeah, I'd rather not talk about that.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_00: What are some things you wish you had done?
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_00: What are some things you think about yourself?
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_00: Well.
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_00: There's probably a lot, but, um.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm always working on being more optimistic.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: It's been challenging.
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_00: It takes time.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_00: But, um.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I wish I could hear my own internal voice better.
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: Is there anything you remember?
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: Oh, you think about, um, euh.
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_00: I have regrets, sure.
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_00: What advice would you give yourself two months or 20 minutes ago?
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_00: Value myself more so that I would make better relationship decisions.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00:

[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_00: My fiancé is the most positive person in my life, my ultimate supporter.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_00: He's, I think, very unique, not at all selfish, and probably a little too giving for his own
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_00: good, but always has my best interests at heart, has the highest morals of anyone I
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_00: know, would give somebody the shirt off of his back, is a genius in the sense that he
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_00: is a very good person in so many ways, and I'm pretty lucky, I think.
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_00: What is the most positive in your life?
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_00: That I'm not a quitter, that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_00: of time I haven't...
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_00: I'm not a quitter.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to talk about this, but I've been childless for a long time and I'll never
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_00: As long as I can say you were by my side, I'm yours.
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: I think it's incredible, that you always can still be who you are, so I know you will
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
