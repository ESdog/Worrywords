[00:00:00] SPEAKER_00: Should I move my arms around?
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_00: Oh.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: Oh.
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_00: Oh.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_00: Interesting.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_00: And if it's not,
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: it would say, don't answer that.
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to answer that.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_00: Just remember that's all.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_00: Do I push a button to start or does she start on her own?
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: Impressive.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: Fine.
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_00: How about you?
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_00: Here.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_00: The weather.
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_00: The weather.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_00: The weather mainly.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the weather.
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_00: Not the people, but some of the people.
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_00: Stuff like that.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_00: Some people, yeah.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_00: I'm cutting you off.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: Not as much as I used to.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_00: I used to be in school and used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that,
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_00: but I'm not in school right now.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_00: Later I'll get back into school and I'll travel more.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_00: But right now, no doubt.
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: Do you enjoy traveling?
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_00: I don't.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: I don't enjoy traveling.
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: What did you study at school?
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_00: That's a good question.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: You're actually pretty good.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: I studied physics and aerospace engineering, but physics mainly.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: Are you still working on that?
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: Yes, I am, actually.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: What do you do now?
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_00: Right now I teach community college physics and astronomy.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_00: But I still do research in physics also because I like that type of thing.
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_00: And I'm going back to grad school.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_00: Hopefully that's why I'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire.
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_00: Awesome.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_00: Impressive.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_00: Good job.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_00: Professor at a place like USC or UCLA or something like that,
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_00: where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_00: You're actually pretty good at this.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: There's a lot of people.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: The first one, I guess, is my physics teacher, AP physics teacher in high school.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: Even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major,
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: he still was a very good influence.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_00: He told me, you know, he's the first one who taught me that
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: school is not about a grade but about learning.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: I'm pretty good, I think.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: I'm single, so I don't get many arguments.
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_00: But it's probably my brother about
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_00: he doing things too, playing a video game together.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_00: I know I'm pretty old to play video games, but they're actually pretty good.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_00: It's probably something like that.
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_00: And me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_00: That's all.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_00: Barely close.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_00: I see them pretty often.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_00: Parents, I see them a couple times a week.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_00: They're getting older, so I help them eat groceries and things like that.
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_00: And my brother, I see the same with them.
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: Same with them.
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: Same with them.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: Same with them.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: My sister, I tutor her kids, my nephews.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_00: So I see them about once a week or so.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: Interesting.
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_00: Because I spend long periods of time doing math and reading
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: and not talking to anybody.
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_00: That's introverted.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: That's introverted.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: I guess I play.
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_00: I play video games or and I work out.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_00: I work out, I think, a lot.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_00: I try to at least.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: I roll my eyes, which I've been told is a bad thing.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_00: And that's about it, I think.
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_00: What do you think is the biggest thing?
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_00: Bad parenting.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: Why are parents more selfish?
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: But basically, parents are more self-centered, more under themselves
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_00: I like previous generations and the kids just do what they want
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: because parents aren't there for the
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: parents are being passed icy by in my personal opinion.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_00: Well,
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_00: I guess they're like old friends to me,
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_00: you know,
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_00: I haven't heard of any school of law.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_00: I guess...
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: I don't really have a best friend.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_00: Introvert, remember.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_00: I'm biased, obviously.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: But they are...
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: I'm really good in math.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_00: I'm not really sure if you can't...
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: Not saying you can't get better than me in math,
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: but the thing is,
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: it's just that you get a certain confidence with it
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_00: where no matter what it is you need to learn in math,
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: you've always figured it out.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: I am patient, I think.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: And I am disciplined where I can spend...
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: I can spend many hours, many, many, many hours
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: reading books that might not be important,
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_00: but they might be important, so I have to do it anyway.
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_00: That type of thing.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_00: When I...
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: A good workout.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_00: Doing well in video games, small, middle, things like that.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_00: When something happens with my research type thing,
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: mathematical or physics type thing,
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: when it goes well, that puts me in a good mood.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: Right now,
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_00: is the fact that...
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_00: research.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_00: That I did make it this far...
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_00: research-wise, that's all.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: That's all.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: Interesting.
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_00: When you start off in school,
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_00: you read about Einstein and things like that,
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_00: he says general relativity and you hear about particle physics,
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: you have no idea what it is.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_00: You know it's very complicated, things like quantum mechanics.
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_00: And you still haven't realized you're interested in that,
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_00: but you're not sure you're interested in that.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: You're not sure you can actually make it.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_00: And eventually, each step of a lot of time goes by,
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: you...
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: As time goes on, you get closer and closer,
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_00: you make the goal,
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: you realize you are just not as good as Einstein,
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_00: but you are up there, you can do research in physics,
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_00: you can add to advanced knowledge in science,
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: and that's impressive that you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_00: A few weeks ago when I got a good grade in the class.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: Yes, briefly.
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_00: Many years ago.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_00: Just I was growing up, I always thought that was,
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_00: I always thought it was my dream when I was a kid.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_00: That's why.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_00: And I just went about doing that.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_00: How old were you when you were in the military?
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: Were you married when you were in the military?
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_00: How did you get into the military?
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_00: I don't think it did.
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_00: I think it's just something you grew up,
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: something about,
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: something I grew up already expecting to be,
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_00: something that didn't really change me as much.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_00: What did you do after you were in the military?
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: Graduate school in physics.
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been in a military?
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been in a military?
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it to get into the military?
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_00: It depends if I work out really hard the day before.
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_00: If I work out pretty hard, it's bad.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_00: But if I don't work out, I don't know, it's hard.
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_00: I guess moderately.
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_00: Do you work out very often?
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_00: It's okay.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you're in the military?
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: Probably like I am now.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_00: Normal. I think not as happy about everything,
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_00: but still pretty okay.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_00: I still function.
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever studied anything in the military?
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: Maybe.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: Maybe.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_00: No. Maybe slightly.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: Sorry. No. Yes.
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_00: Yes, I have changes in my thoughts.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_00: Okay. Tell me more about that.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_00: I'm applying to grad school again.
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_00: It's been a while.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_00: And slightly different.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: And slightly different.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: I'm really apprehensive.
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_00: Happy that it looks good, but apprehensive
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_00: that it might not be good.
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_00: And things like that.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: What do you mean by that?
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_00: I know it's your computer.
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_00: But as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts?
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: Or how hard is it to go into grad school?
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_00: I understand.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if I'm the right person.
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_00: I agree.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_00: .
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: No, not really.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_00: .
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_00: What advice would you give yourself
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: . . . . . . . . probably, keep doing
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_00: what you're doing.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_00: Even though I'm not that old believe it or not. 20 years ago
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_00: I was probably 15.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_00: No?
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I was 15.
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_00: Just keep doing what you're doing.
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_00: I think I was very lucky
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_00: and fortunate the way it worked out.
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_00: If it was a little bit different,
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_00: I don't think it would work out so well.
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_00: Even though it's not perfect now,
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_00: I think we're doing really well,
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_00: personally.
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_00: Same here.
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_00: Goodbye.
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_02: I'll keep this on.
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_02: Take this off now?
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

I think I was very lucky and fortunate the way it worked out. If it was a little bit different, I don't think it would work out so well. Even though it's not perfect now, I think we're doing really well, personally. Thank you. Same here. Goodbye. I'll keep this on. Take this off now? Yeah.
