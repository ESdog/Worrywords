[00:07:54] SPEAKER_00: If you, yeah.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_00: It gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: And hopefully they can give you answers.
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_00: Most of them don't.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_00: They try to find the answers inside of you.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: Get it out of you.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_00: But it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kind of bias neutral.

[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: Why should you be an introvert, and why do you care?
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_00: Because I'm not going to have any self- Immerse myself in what I said.
