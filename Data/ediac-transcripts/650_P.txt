[00:00:53] SPEAKER_00: Do you travel a lot?
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: Not recently. I traveled mostly while I was in the military.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_00: The military is always on the go. So most of the travel being so expensive, I could only afford it through traveling and military business.

[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: What's your dream job?
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_00: Probably in the same industry. Private security that would be high paying.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_00: Or something along the lines of mental health or something like what we're doing right now.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_00: As long as it helps provide for the family and pay the bills.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: What's your favorite thing about LA?
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: The most memorable experience.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: More outgoing than shy.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about your relationship with your family.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm...

[00:02:48] SPEAKER_02: Uh...
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_00: I watch TV and spend time with my family.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_00: Very good, actually. Very, very controlled. I have to in my field.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: It was with my wife, and it was...
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_00: It was about finances.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about a situation that you wish you had done differently.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_00: That's a good question.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: All right.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: I believe...
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_00: Something you feel guilty about.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: Coming to California and leaving my oldest daughters in Florida.
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_00: Leaving the military.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: It was for finances.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_00: And...
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_00: And I knew I had to go.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_00: So, in 1997, I made the choice, and all I had known was the military.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_00: So, that was pretty hard.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_00: All right.
[00:04:35] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about a moment or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: Probably some of my past.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: Before the military.
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_00: I was in a relationship.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: Not a girlfriend-boyfriend relationship.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: I was basically victimized by my mother.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_00: I wish I could erase that.
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_00: But in a way, it kind of makes me who I am.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever served in the military?
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_00: Almost nine years.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_00: U.S. Air Force.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_00: How old were you when you joined the military?
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_00: 18 years old.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: When did you decide to join the military?
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_00: I had no other choice.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_00: It was either go in the military or stay out on the streets in New York City.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_00: I had no money for college and no chance at getting a good job.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: So, I enlisted.
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: Are you happy with your choice?
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_00: Yes, absolutely.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: Probably the best choice in fixing my life growing up that I ever made.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: Did you ever see combat?
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_00: Three separate times, yes.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_00: How easy was it for you to go back to the building?
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: I had some growing pains at first.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_00: It was a little bit difficult in the beginning.
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_00: But I adjusted.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: That's amazing.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: What did you do after the military?
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_00: Private security.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: Oh, really?
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_00: And then law enforcement.
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: What did the military change you?
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: It gave me a sense of regimentation.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: It gave me structure that I wouldn't have otherwise done.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_00: And I believe as far as within people in just the general population, it does set you aside.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: It sets you apart.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_00: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_00: All right, I guess.
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_00: And a bit of a struggle sometimes.
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_00: Just seeking employment.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_00: And it's very difficult, especially with the way things are.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_00: Have you noticed anything in your career that's not really?
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_00: Not really.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: Just trying to land that dream job, as you said before.
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_00: Pretty easy, especially if I've been active throughout the day.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_00: And that's usually every day.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: Tired, first of all.
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_00: And can't concentrate well.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: Are you not very taxed about going to bed?
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but it's hard.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: So four to seven years is not big for me.
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_00: No, I don't have to bring you a littleSab from your family that's like,

[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: I'll probably never make an article about背kelylene.

[00:09:03] SPEAKER_00: 1992 yeah 1992 cold sweats nightmares night terrors disorientation waking up
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_00: not knowing where I am things of that sort
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_00: not that I'm aware of it was it was all
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_00: most mostly following one of my combat
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_00: experiences in South America I went to
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_00: Columbia on one on President Bush's war
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_00: on drugs
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: and
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: we had the we we had to live in the
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_00: jungle and while in the jungle we also
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: had to take a couple of lives while we
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_00: were there we so that was one of the
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_00: three instances that I saw combat action
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_00: I learned a long time ago that I was a
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_00: part of the military and I learned a
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_00: long time ago that you have to put your
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: past behind you so I just do I I had to
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_00: put it behind me it was not easy but it
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: was the right thing to do and it was so
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: that others may live I so it was it may
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_00: not have felt right at the time but it
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_00: was the right thing to do
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_00: in the military when you have a combat
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_00: related experience you always go through
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_00: a debrief at the debrief you are asked
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_00: if you need help coping with the
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_00: situation so of course I immediately
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_00: raised my hand told them I need help
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_00: with coping with the situation and I'm
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: however fortunate I do believe that I
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_00: scanners and I think this is probably
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_00: myNE for the rest of my life so at the
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_00: time realized that it was just too difficult
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_00: for me to make a worrying decision here
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: spicy here is the alert place that takes
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: you out but I just want to take you for

[00:12:24] SPEAKER_00: I learned enough coping skills
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_00: that were good enough to be able to cast that aside
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_00: and not depend upon any facet of treatment or anything else.
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_00: Do you feel therapy is important?
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_00: Yes, I do feel it is.
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_00: Throwing medication at that kind of problem
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: sometimes is necessary,

[00:13:01] SPEAKER_00: any of that.
