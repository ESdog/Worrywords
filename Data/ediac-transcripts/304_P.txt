[00:01:59] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_01: Like especially in transfer relationships when they lie to you about something that's very minimal.

[00:02:40] SPEAKER_01: Uh, it's okay. It's cool. It's fine.

[00:02:50] SPEAKER_01: Tell me more about that.
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_01: Um, they're friendly. It's just that they're very quiet. So I'm not used to that.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_01: Oh. What's it like for you living with them?
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_01: It's fine. Like the, how much it costs is very cheap. So that's good. And they're friendly.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_01: So it's fine. I just wish it was a little bit, it could have been better. So, yeah.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_01: Have you done anything to avoid it?
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_01: Can you say a little more about that?
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: Um, I had a different upbringing.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_01: I had a different option to live with somebody else. And I'm still friends with a female.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_01: And it comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_01: So I kind of regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who I was supposed to move in with in the beginning.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_01: So, but I'm stuck for a year. So it's whatever.
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_01: That's fine.

[00:04:05] SPEAKER_01: I feel sorry for my esex life.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_01: That's for sure, yeah.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_01: So it's hard.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_01: I have to biteth in and make the conversation more exciting even, because it's not because I achieve it, I just feel bitchy.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_01: Really?
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes these relationship, life struggles are like the best thing ever.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_01: So, because you establish a relationship, is it difficult?
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_01: Um, maybe when it comes to schools, how they treat the children, especially children of color, maybe.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_01: I feel like it's going to be mad.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_01: Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert?
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_01: Why?
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_01: Because I do things from within, I guess. I'm internally motivated to do things, I guess. Yeah.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_01: Do you feel that way often?
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_01: Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_01: Wow. I hardly ever argue with somebody.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_01: Really?
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Oh, my sister, I guess. My sister. That was about a month ago.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_01: How did you feel in that moment?
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_01: I felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister, and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because I'm an adult.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, I was not feeling the situation at all.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_01: Can you tell me about that?
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_01: Um.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_01: So, just her getting into grown folks' business, and it was a conversation between me and my mother, and I guess she overheard what was being said, and she felt like through my actions that I was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_01: But because she didn't know the whole situation, she just automatically assumed and put stuff on Facebook about me disrespecting me, calling me out my name, and it was...
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_01: Mom.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So...
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_01: And she didn't come to me about it. Like, she just did all this other stuff on Facebook.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_01: I don't... That's one thing I don't like either is when you... I hate indirect comments.
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_01: Like, if you have... If you need to talk to me, come directly to me. Don't put it on Facebook, tell other people. That's a pet peeve of mine. I really don't like that.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So... But, I mean, we're fine now. So, that's good.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_01: That's so good to hear.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_01: To not believe people so easily? So gullible? To not be so gullible.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_01: Okay. Tell me more about that.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_01: I guess I'd have been hearing that lately how I believe anybody... anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_01: So...
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_01: I guess you could say I made a lot of mistakes. I don't want to say I regretted it because I'm glad I went through it while I was younger than me knowing and going through the same situations.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_01: So... Yeah. I believe people too easily. And I give people too many chances. So... Yeah.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_01: What's one of your most memorable experiences?
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_01: When I went on a cruise, which was a happy experience. So when I went on a cruise to Mexico with my family when I was 16... about 6 years ago.

[00:11:41] SPEAKER_01: So, yeah.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_01: Why?

FULL TRANSCRIPTION:

 Perfect, okay. So we'll just move around a little bit so that the Xbox Kinect can sense you. So if you just want to move a little bit, dance around until you see a stick figure. Oh, okay. Whoa. There it goes, there it goes. Okay, great. When this is finished, can you just ring the doorbell and let me know? Yeah. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? I'm doing great. Good. Where are you from originally? From Los Angeles, California. Nice. What are some things you really like about LA? The cool weather, the beaches, the people, the schools. Mm-hmm. What did you study at school? Child development. Nice. Are you still doing that? Yes. What's your dream job? To be a teacher for special education. How hard is that? Isn't that hard? Because I love to work for children. Really? Yes. What are some things that make you really mad? Dishonesty, maybe. Can you give me an example of that? Like if a guy, like a student, is mad at me or something, then I'm mad. Like especially in transfer relationships when they lie to you about something that's very minimal. Yeah. Who's some of the positive influence in your life? My mom. I want to see my mom. Oh. How close are you to them? Um, very close. We talk every day. That's so good to hear. How close are you to your family? Very close. Even though I don't live with them, I try to see them as much as I can. How do you like your living situation? Uh, it's okay. It's cool. It's fine. Do you have roommates? Yes, I do. Tell me more about that. Um, they're friendly. It's just that they're very quiet. So I'm not used to that. Oh. What's it like for you living with them? It's fine. Like the, how much it costs is very cheap. So that's good. And they're friendly. So it's fine. I just wish it was a little bit, it could have been better. So, yeah. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yes. Can you say a little more about that? Um, I had a different upbringing. I had a different option to live with somebody else. And I'm still friends with a female. And it comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with. So I kind of regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who I was supposed to move in with in the beginning. So, but I'm stuck for a year. So it's whatever. That's fine. How do you know them? How do I know who? I don't know. I just don't even understand that. I feel sorry for my esex life. That's for sure, yeah. So it's hard. I have to biteth in and make the conversation more exciting even, because it's not because I achieve it, I just feel bitchy. Really? Sometimes these relationship, life struggles are like the best thing ever. So, because you establish a relationship, is it difficult? Okay. Um, maybe when it comes to schools, how they treat the children, especially children of color, maybe. I feel like it's going to be mad. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Yes. Why? Because I do things from within, I guess. I'm internally motivated to do things, I guess. Yeah. Do you feel that way often? Yeah. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Wow. I hardly ever argue with somebody. Okay. Really? Yeah. Oh, my sister, I guess. My sister. That was about a month ago. How did you feel in that moment? I felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister, and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because I'm an adult. So, yeah, I was not feeling the situation at all. Can you tell me about that? Um. Okay. So, just her getting into grown folks' business, and it was a conversation between me and my mother, and I guess she overheard what was being said, and she felt like through my actions that I was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case. But because she didn't know the whole situation, she just automatically assumed and put stuff on Facebook about me disrespecting me, calling me out my name, and it was... Mom. Yeah. So... And she didn't come to me about it. Like, she just did all this other stuff on Facebook. I don't... That's one thing I don't like either is when you... I hate indirect comments. Like, if you have... If you need to talk to me, come directly to me. Don't put it on Facebook, tell other people. That's a pet peeve of mine. I really don't like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So... But, I mean, we're fine now. So, that's good. That's so good to hear. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To not believe people so easily? So gullible? To not be so gullible. Okay. Tell me more about that. I guess I'd have been hearing that lately how I believe anybody... anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it. So... I guess you could say I made a lot of mistakes. I don't want to say I regretted it because I'm glad I went through it while I was younger than me knowing and going through the same situations. So... Yeah. I believe people too easily. And I give people too many chances. So... Yeah. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When I went on a cruise, which was a happy experience. So when I went on a cruise to Mexico with my family when I was 16... about 6 years ago. Wow. Yeah. That's a long time. Yeah. I mean... Yeah. I guess... Do you travel a lot? No. I really want to though. What do you enjoy about traveling? Um... I think I love traveling. I love traveling. I love traveling. I love trying new things, seeing new views of the world, trying the different types of foods, seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there, I guess. Um... And what do you do about your trip? Yeah. I plan to go to the Bahamas next year. I plan to do a lot of traveling last year, actually. So... Really? Yeah. Okay. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty good. Um... somewhat. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm tired. And I kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot. Do you feel that way often? Yeah. It's my fault though. When was the last time that happened? Um... I think it was when I was in high school. Um... probably today. Wow. Yeah. Why? Well, I fell asleep late. So... it's my fault. Oh. Okay. Do you feel down? Um... no. I feel pretty happy right now. That's good. Mm-hmm. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you ever served in the military? No. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? Very friendly and funny. Talkative. How do you know them? Um... through high school. Cool. How close are you to them? We're pretty close. We try to talk as often as possible. Maybe once a week. Um... try to see them at least once a week. Oh, they can't speak to you? They're very friendly. Are they your favorite kids? No. Are they your favorite kids? Are they your favorite kids? Mm. They're everywhere. Okay. Um... I... yeah. No comment off of that. They're more smart. They are learning more stuff than what we learned back in the day. They are learning. They're very progressing. But, when it comes to technology they're not outside. I see. They're always on the computer, on their phones. They don't play outside no more. They don't care about nature or about the little things in life. But when it comes to their mentality, they are getting smarter because the schools are getting better. I ain't going to lie. Yeah. When was the last time that happened? What happened? Let's come back to that later. When was the last time you felt really happy? Last weekend, I guess. I'd love to hear all about it. Right now? What did I do? Being on my boyfriend makes me really happy. So, yeah. I was just hanging out with him last weekend. And I never really get to see him that much. So, yeah. Why? Because he works, I have school, different schedules. That sounds really hard. It's not that bad. How do you know them? He's my boyfriend. I've been knowing him for about, what, six months now. We met through a mutual friend in L.A., I guess. Awesome. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Good night. But how long has it been like this? Three more moments would be good enough. Four, three, one... No, no, no, no. Two, two, one... Oh, no, no, I can't hear from you right now. Great. Oh, my God. them in the comments. I'm not part of it, so sorry about that. Weird. Okay, let's go ahead and shut this down.
