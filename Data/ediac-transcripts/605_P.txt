[00:02:04] SPEAKER_04: What are some things you really like about LA?
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_04: The weather and that it's a little bit laid back.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_04: Some people say that in terms of musical beat, LA is a little bit behind the beat or just a little laid back.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_04: What are some things you don't really like about LA?

[00:02:29] SPEAKER_04: 
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_04: 
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_04: People don't really like passion.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_04: That's why some people think it's really bad.
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_04: And especially people like what you're singing are either good Themen or won't like the music, or agree with it in general, that it's'll work.
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_04: What's your relationship like?
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_04: Well, I have really removed a lot of money from me, from jazz music, kicking away at the time.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_04: 
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_04: I don't like it
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_04: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fish Tape screensaver.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_04: Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_04: What do you do to relax?
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_04: There's a meditation tape that has a fire burning in the background and kind of does
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_04: stress reduction dialogue.
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_04: I listen to that.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_04: What are some things that make you really mad?
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_04: People being inconsiderate or unconscious about their effects on others.
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_04: Can you give me an example of that?
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_04: When people will drop trash without any regard.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_04: And I'm like, I'm not going to do that.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_04: And leave it for somebody else to pick up.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_04: What do you do when you're annoyed?
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_04: I tend to internalize it and try and move past it.
