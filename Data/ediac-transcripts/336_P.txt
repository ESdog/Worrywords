[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: Uh, well...
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_00: watching TV and stuff, but
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: lately I've just been feeling like I need to

[00:11:42] SPEAKER_00: have less judgment and more fun.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: That's good. What made you decide to do that?

[00:12:17] SPEAKER_00: take off work and...
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_00: be in a different environment.
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_00: Because my job is stressful and my life
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_00: is stressful, so...
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_00: I was able to take a break, which is great.
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_00: That's good. How would your best friend describe you?
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_00: Uh, outgoing, fun, smart...
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_00: But I'm in L.A.
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_00: L.A. they don't want to...
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_00: Most of them don't want to spend time with you.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh. I don't know if that's because of me
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_00: or L.A.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: That makes sense.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_00: Is there anything you regret?
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_00: That I spend a lot of my time worrying and
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_00: criticizing myself instead of moving forward.
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_00: Have you done anything to avoid it?
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_00: Avoid it?
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm watching TV or going to see movies or
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_00: trying not to think of it, but it doesn't solve the problem.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: Has that gotten you in trouble?
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_00: Well, a little bit. I haven't paid my bills a lot.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: I still owe money.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_00: So, um...
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_00: It's kind of a self-defeating prophecy.
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_00: What advice would you give yourself
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_00: to someone who's in trouble?
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_00: Stop criticizing and start creating your future now
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: instead of waiting for it to happen.
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_00: Hmm...
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_00: Is there someone that's been a positive influence in your life?
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_00: My girlfriend's been really helpful.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_00: Tell me more about that.
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_00: Well, she's funny and she loves me and cares about me and...
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_00: That's all good to hear.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_00: Ha ha.

[00:14:51] SPEAKER_00: I've written about four or five books.
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_00: I, uh...
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_00: My voice, I think, will be number one.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_00: Because when I started, I didn't have much of a singing voice.
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: But now I do.
[00:15:04] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_00: Okay.

Where are you from and where do you live? Indianapolis, Indiana. Really? Why do you live in LA? I'm a singer. Awesome. How did you decide to do that? I like singing. Uh huh. Okay. I'm going to ask you a question. What are some things you really like about LA? Diversity. My girlfriend's from Taiwan, so dealing with different cultures. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic, the crazy people. It seems hard to get anything to do with LA. I'm not sure what I like about LA. I like being really accomplished. Yeah. I see what you mean. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It took me about six months just to figure out the directions. When did you move to LA? Twenty-eight years ago. Wow. That's a long time. A long time. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been there in about a year. I haven't been there in about eight or ten years. Why? Well, I don't like my brothers, so I don't want to hang around them. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I started my girlfriend, we did about, just went back, got back from Orlando, and she likes to travel, so. Nice. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like to travel. I like to go out. I like to meet new people, see new places. It helps me to get out of LA and get a different perspective. I must have heard about one of your trips. I just did the Avatar seminar, which is like a, raise your consciousness and clean out the crap in your head. Uh-huh. Are you happy to do that? Um. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just, yeah, I feel better. I have a lot of psychic attack and it's, I'm psychic, so it's very hard to deal with it. Wow. Tell me more about that. Um, well, um, there's more to life than what you see, so. A lot of things are in other dimensions and other places, so you have to deal with not only the emotions, but people direct energy at you. How hard is that? Um, well, you have to do a lot of clearing and grounding and stay true to yourself. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? I'm both. Why? Well, I'm introverted because I like to spend time by myself and I'm extroverted because I like to meet new people. Uh, I used to be totally an introvert. Mm-hmm. What do you do to relax? Watch movies, watch TV, read. Uh-huh. Uh, do crosswords. I'm a singer, sing, write music. I'm writing a novel. What were you about? Um, it's sort of like the Matrix. Awesome. How hard is that? Um, well, I wrote the first 20 pages pretty quick, so, um, now I'm expanding it. What made you decide to do that? I get inspiration. Uh, it was actually a dream and then I wrote down the dream and now it's becoming, uh, I could probably turn it into a movie. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. What are some things that make you feel you're winning out? Uh, when people don't respect me. That's the number one. Okay. Do you do that way often? No, I just, my brothers, they don't respect me. They don't really, uh, you know, I want to love my family, but I don't want to hang around my brothers, so it's a conflict. That sucks. Exactly. How are you at controlling your hunger? Pretty good. I only get mad about once a year. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Uh, my girlfriend about two or three months ago, she was wanting me to do something and I said no. And... I don't know. Yeah? Okay. How do you know that much? She's my girlfriend. I know her for about a year now. How close are you to them? Pretty close. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Um, one time I was singing and I was singing and I was singing and I was singing and I was singing and I was singing and I was singing to an audience and that was great. Um, well I'm looking into ways to expand my consciousness so that I can have more money, and more abundance in my life so I can have my own house and live in my own creative space singing I'm a singer so I think I'm unforgettable so that's what I like to do no no no well that's the hard part I am I don't I don't know maybe it's because when I was a kid my brothers beat me up and I don't feel totally rested in there myself or my life so I feel like I don't feel totally safe yeah a little irritable well I have been sleeping better since I met my girlfriend so not totally bad no way behavior what I don't know um well I feel more positive I did the seminar and so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain and be more positive about life um well I did a lot of exercises to reduce my stress and a lot of my stress comes from uh judging myself and other people yeah you could say that How hard is that? Uh, well... Mmm... Mmm... I don't know, it's hard. Hard to deal with sometimes. Sometimes much too critical for my own good. How do you cope with that? Uh, well... watching TV and stuff, but lately I've just been feeling like I need to um... have less judgment and more fun. That's good. What made you decide to do that? Uh, well I did that seminar. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? Um... About a week ago, I think. Tell me more about that. Uh, well with that seminar, I got there and I was able to take off work and... be in a different environment. Because my job is stressful and my life is stressful, so... I was able to take a break, which is great. That's good. How would your best friend describe you? Uh, outgoing, fun, smart... Uh... But I'm in L.A. L.A. they don't want to... Most of them don't want to spend time with you. Uh-huh. I don't know if that's because of me or L.A. That makes sense. Is there anything you regret? Uh... That I spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward. Have you done anything to avoid it? Uh... Avoid it? Yeah, I'm watching TV or going to see movies or trying not to think of it, but it doesn't solve the problem. Has that gotten you in trouble? Uh... Well, a little bit. I haven't paid my bills a lot. I still owe money. So, um... It's kind of a self-defeating prophecy. What advice would you give yourself to someone who's in trouble? Uh... Stop criticizing and start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen. Hmm... Is there someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh... My girlfriend's been really helpful. Tell me more about that. Well, she's funny and she loves me and cares about me and... Um... That's all good to hear. Ha ha. Yeah. What would you say of some of your best colleagues? Um... Singer and I'm intelligent and creative and multidimensional and... Uh... I'm a good listener. Uh-huh. Yeah. What do you look proud of in your life? Uh... I've written about four or five books. I, uh... My voice, I think, will be number one. Because when I started, I didn't have much of a singing voice. But now I do. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Okay. Bye. Goodbye. Bye. Doorbell. Doorbell. Yeah. Okay, can I take it off? Yeah.
