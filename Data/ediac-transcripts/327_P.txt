[00:05:53] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_00: I mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your likes, your dislikes, your problems, and sometimes somebody else is going through the same thing you are, and you can share what you're going through and what can help make it better.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_00: I'm a little bit more of a person than most people.

[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: Pretty good.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_00: Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: No. Just getting more positive, better.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: That's good. Do you still go to therapy now?
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_00: It's not. It's about 50-50. Some nights I sleep good and some nights I don't.
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_00: That's tough.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?

[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00:

[00:09:27] SPEAKER_00: Have you done anything to avoid it?
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: No, because I was raising two kids by myself, so now that they're grown, I have no excuse, so I'm doing it.
