[00:00:08] SPEAKER_02: Now I'm going to bring up our virtual movie maker just a second here.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_02: You'll get to see what she looks like.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to try to put her back down.
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_02: While I do that, I'm going to have you put your hands behind me.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_02: Just like this.
[00:00:26] SPEAKER_02: It's almost as old as some of those pictures.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_02: There we go. Perfect.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to put this behind your body also.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_01: So we can wait for a couple other things to pop up.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_01: A few caveats before we get started.
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_01: As you've seen today, technology does not always work perfectly.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_01: So while you're talking to her, she's going to pause certain times because she's trying to let you talk and things.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_01: If you notice a pause that's ten seconds or longer, please go ahead and press this button and let me know.
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_01: It's not supposed to happen.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_01: Every once in a while it happens, so I don't want you to be sitting here wondering what's going to happen next.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_01: Another thing is that a lot of people would love to ask Ellie, that's her name,
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_01: I'll ask her some questions about herself, but unfortunately she's not yet capable of answering questions about herself.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_01: So she'll be the one asking all the questions.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_01: So just letting you know that you won't be able to ask her anything.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_01: So when I leave the room, she's going to start asking you questions.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_01: And then when she's done, she's going to say goodbye and then you're going to press this doorbell to let me know that you guys are all done.
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_01: All right.
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
