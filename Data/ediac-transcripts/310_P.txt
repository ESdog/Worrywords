[00:01:33] SPEAKER_02: Seattle.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_02: It's kind of a largely different thing than Hollywood, but

[00:01:34] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_02: There's no change in the world.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_02: It's a different generation of natural phenomena.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_02: The two of them live in the same neighborhood.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_02: Why?
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_02: Maybe that's my first job.

[00:01:49] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_02: You don't do flu basis.

[00:01:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_02: What, flying on an airplane?
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_02: Probably December of 1986 or 87.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_02: I must have heard that on your text.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_02: Nothing much to tell, really.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_02: Usually I just go from L.A. up to Seattle and up to Vancouver.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_02: That's probably the main thing I do.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_02: Take the train.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_02: Awesome.
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_02: How often do you go back to L.A.?
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_02: Not very often.

[00:02:42] SPEAKER_02: Do you have any other questions?
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_02: Absolutely, yeah.
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_02: What do you do in your day-to-day life?
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_02: It depends on what.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_02: It is that I'm annoyed by.
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_02: It could be anything.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_02: It depends.
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_02: Can you say a little more about that?
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_02: It depends on whether it's a something or a someone.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_02: You know, if it's a someone, I mean, I don't get physical towards them,
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_02: but I mean, it depends on what they've done to piss me off.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I'm certainly not above shouting at them for whatever reason.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_02: So it just depends.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_02: How are you at keeping them in?
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_02: I'm not above, you know, in terms of lashing out at other people physically.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_02: I don't do that, but in order to let off some aggressions, if need be, I'm not above, you know,
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_02: punching a wall or punching something nearby.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I'm not trying to.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_02: This as long as it doesn't physically hurt me, but, you know, just get some steam, let off some steam.
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_02: That's normal for me.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_02: When was the last time you had an argument with someone?
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_02: Uh, face-to-face, uh, hmm.
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_02: Can't remember. It's been a long time.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_02: But I mean, I argue with people online about stupid shit.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_02: You know, that's normal shit, but as far as, like, face-to-face, you know, it's been a long time.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
