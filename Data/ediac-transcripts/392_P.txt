[00:00:46] SPEAKER_02: I like the people.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_02: I don't like the traffic.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_02: That's primarily it.
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_02: Sociology.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_02: Yep.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_02: It's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_02: To be a writer.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_02: I like being able to write what I want to write.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_02: Right now I write things that I'm not really...
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_02: that interested in.
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_02: Like what?
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_02: Like articles about teenager culture.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_02: Stuff like that.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_02: What do you think of the new kids?
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_02: I think they have it pretty easy.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_02: I don't know how easy they have it.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_02: I'm sure you can tell by my shoes.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_02: I'm not much of a world explorer.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_02: Do you travel a lot?
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_02: Not really.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_02: Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_02: Depends on the situation or who I'm around.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_02: When I first meet people I can be shy.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_02: But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_02: Uh huh.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_02: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fifth-kings green saver.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_02: Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_02: Haha.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_02: What do you do to relax?
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_02: Umm, I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing or just maybe do something that's
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_02: kind of fun and mind-numbing like watch TV.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_02: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_02: I'm pretty good.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_02: I don't really let anger show that much.
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_02: I'm not like a...I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_02: I'm pretty rational.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_02: That's good.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_02: When was the last time you argued with someone?
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_02: And what was it about?
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_02: Umm...I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_02: What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_02: Umm...I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about your relationship.
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_02: What's your relationship with your family?
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_02: Umm...I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family.
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_02: Why?
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_02: Uhh...because they basically sort of raised me.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_02: Uhh...and my parents weren't really in the picture that much.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_02: I understand.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_02: Umm...
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_02: I can't really think of one right now.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_02: Uhh...I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry.
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_02: Is it uncomfortable?
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_02: Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this?
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_02: Umm...I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband.
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_02: What made you decide to do that?
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_02: Uhh...because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: I was really desperate to get married.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_02: But I still felt like I should stick it out.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_02: How hard was it?
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_02: I mean...it was hard at the time.
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_02: Uhh...but I made the right decision, I think.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_02: Has someone else been a positive influence in your life?
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_02: Uhh...my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age.
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_02: Can you tell me about that?
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_02: Umm...she's just a very strong woman.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: powerful sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_02: Not really super easy. I sort of I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_02: late. Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_02: You mean like my body? Normal, fine, no complaints.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_02: No, it's been the same as ever.
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_02: Uh, last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_02: really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_02: That's great. How were your best friends driving you?
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_02: Uh, probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring.
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_02: Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_02: Uh, I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around reading or going to the movies, watching TV.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_02: Hmm. Is there anything you regret?
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_02: Uh, no. I don't think there's not, I don't think, I think regretting things is a waste of time.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_02: What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_02: Um, don't try to, don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you, then they like you.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_02: What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_02: Um.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_02: What would you say to yourself?
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_02: Uh, I think that I'm a little bit more of a person than I am.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_02: Sometimes, sometimes I can be kind of lazy. Uh, I'd like to have more of a, um, like sort of, uh, better work ethic, I guess.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_02: Can you give me an example of that?
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_02: Uh, just sort of putting off stuff, um, until, you know, right when it's due or after it's due, things like that. Um, procrastinating.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_02: Uh, sometimes for the things that I write, uh, people will write negative things about me, like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_02: That sucks.
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_02: What would you say a familiar person said to you?
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_02: I'm, uh, articulate and funny and a good friend.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm.
