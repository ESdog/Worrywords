[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: I'd love to hear about one of your trips.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_00: Uh, okay.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_00: I, oh, I went to, um, France a few years ago.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: Well, many years ago.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_00: And a little town called Carcassonne.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_00: And was very, um, it was, it was actually really fun.
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_00: But very much like a storybook as far as what I expected to see and what I actually saw.
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_00: Like, I, what I remember that I really liked.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_00: Was that at night when everybody closes up.
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: Like, there are no windows in the buildings.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: But there are these shutters that most places in the United States have inside of windows.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: They have them outside of the windows.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: And there's no glass.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: So you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: Like the buildings are abandoned.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: So, pretty cool.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: I like that.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_00: Cool.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_00: I'm borderline.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I'm shy.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I'm outgoing.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_00: It depends on who and what the situation is.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank's screen saver.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_01: Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: What do you do to relax?
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: Um, music.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_00: I turn on music.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: I walk.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: I walk through the neighborhoods, you know.
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: I'm pretty good at controlling my temper.
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_00: I'm not a hothead at all.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_00: Oh, it was an ex-roommate.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_00: And it was about my loyalty as a friend.
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_00: Um, pretty much she, um, thought that because I wanted my rent, which she agreed to pay,
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_00: that I was not being a good friend, that I should just let her live for free.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: And that wasn't going to happen.
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her live for free.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: And I was letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_00: So, that's a friend.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: I could have kicked her out.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: I didn't.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_00: She left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_00: But, you know, she could have, um, could have, could have been a bad situation.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: But there was an argument there.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: A real, a real one.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_00: I wish I had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_00: And, um, gotten my money up front.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: That's what I wish I had done.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_00: And I just, I didn't.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_00: My mind told me to go along with it.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: No, my mind told me to get the money up front.
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_00: But I didn't.
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_00: So.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_00: I see.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_00: The hardest decision.
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_00: I think I have yet to make the hardest decision.
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_00: But so far, like, maybe, um, leaving home.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: Leaving home when I was, years ago, when I was like 18.
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: How did you feel in that moment?
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_00: I felt like I was abandoning my family.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_00: That's what I felt.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: But, um, they encouraged me to go on and live my life.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: Uh.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_00: Something that I could erase from my memory.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: Probably.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: Probably a friend who I was, um, dating.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_00: I would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when I told him my grandmother, um, was ill.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_00: It's easy if I'm busy all day and I'm really, really tired.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_00: But, actually, my mind spins, so.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: It's not that easy, actually.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_00: It's not that easy.
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_00: I'd have to.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_00: Because I have to be exhausted.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_00: I have to be exhausted.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_00: That sounds really hard.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: To be exhausted?
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_00: It's not really hard.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_00: You just do a lot of stuff all day long.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_00: Irritable.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_00: Okay.

[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: Like, sometimes I've been excited and anxious, and on the other side, I'm like, hmm.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_00: What am I doing?
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: Are you triggered by something?
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, just an anxiousness to want to make some things happen.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: Some goals.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_00: Like what?
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_00: Getting certain kind of work.

[00:10:50] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I need to be focused on in the moment.
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_00: And I'm conscious of that.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, of all the things that's popping up in my head, why am I thinking about that?
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_00: How do you cope with them?
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_00: I let them happen, and then I try to think about other things and phase it out.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_00: It pops back up, I phase it out.

Maybe that's all I don't like. Yeah. I don't, you know, I like, I don't like that it's so far away from home. I wish, I wish L.A. was kind of Midwest. I wish it wasn't so far from home. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a close relationship with my family. Um. It's a small, immediate family is really small. And we're close. My grandmother recently passed. So it's, um, an adjustment right now. But I'm close to my family. Okay. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Well, I can't see your shoes. But I do travel often. I do travel, yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? Um, getting there. I like getting there. Um, once I'm at the, wherever I'm going, I like to actually do the tourist thing. Get to know places. And people. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Uh, okay. I, oh, I went to, um, France a few years ago. Well, many years ago. And a little town called Carcassonne. And was very, um, it was, it was actually really fun. But very much like a storybook as far as what I expected to see and what I actually saw. Like, I, what I remember that I really liked. Was that at night when everybody closes up. Like, there are no windows in the buildings. But there are these shutters that most places in the United States have inside of windows. They have them outside of the windows. And there's no glass. So you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned. Like the buildings are abandoned. So, pretty cool. I like that. Cool. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm borderline. Sometimes I'm shy. Sometimes I'm outgoing. It depends on who and what the situation is. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Um, music. I turn on music. I walk. I walk through the neighborhoods, you know. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good at controlling my temper. I'm not a hothead at all. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Hmm. Oh, it was an ex-roommate. And it was about my loyalty as a friend. Can you tell me about that? Yeah. Um, pretty much she, um, thought that because I wanted my rent, which she agreed to pay, that I was not being a good friend, that I should just let her live for free. And that wasn't going to happen. So, you know, the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her live for free. And I was letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me. So, that's a friend. I could have kicked her out. I didn't. She left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay. But, you know, she could have, um, could have, could have been a bad situation. But there was an argument there. A real, a real one. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I wish I had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily. And, um, gotten my money up front. That's what I wish I had done. And I just, I didn't. My mind told me to go along with it. No, my mind told me to get the money up front. But I didn't. So. I see. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. The hardest decision. Um. I think I have yet to make the hardest decision. But so far, like, maybe, um, leaving home. Leaving home when I was, years ago, when I was like 18. Yeah. How did you feel in that moment? Um. I felt like I was abandoning my family. That's what I felt. But, um, they encouraged me to go on and live my life. That's good. Mm-hmm. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Uh. Something that I could erase from my memory. Probably. Probably a friend who I was, um, dating. I would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when I told him my grandmother, um, was ill. Hmm. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Um. It's easy if I'm busy all day and I'm really, really tired. But, actually, my mind spins, so. It's not that easy, actually. It's not that easy. I'd have to. Because I have to be exhausted. I have to be exhausted. That sounds really hard. To be exhausted? No. It's not really hard. You just do a lot of stuff all day long. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Irritable. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Up and down. I've been up and down. Like, sometimes I've been excited and anxious, and on the other side, I'm like, hmm. What am I doing? Are you triggered by something? Yeah, just an anxiousness to want to make some things happen. Some goals. Like what? Getting certain kind of work. And having a certain amount of income. And just taking care of myself. Okay. You know, the way I think I should take care of myself. Just the physical stuff. Uh-huh. Eating right and everything. Have you ever studied changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yeah, I have. Can you tell me about that? Sometimes I have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I need to be focused on in the moment. And I'm conscious of that. I'm like, of all the things that's popping up in my head, why am I thinking about that? How do you cope with them? I let them happen, and then I try to think about other things and phase it out. It pops back up, I phase it out. Yeah. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh... When the roommate moved out, I was really happy when she finally left. Tell me how you spend your annual weekend. I'm probably reading and maybe I'll go dancing. That would be ideal. I can go dancing. Go salsa dancing. And, yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? My ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. Really badly. I don't know if I have a time when someone has ever made me feel really badly. I don't feel bad about much. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? As courageous. As courageous? As courageous as you can be. Uh-huh. That would be it in a nutshell. Okay. Is there anything you regret? In general? Yeah. Um... I regret not making some different decisions when I was younger as far as moving forward, as far as career stuff and relationship things. I wish I had done some things earlier in my life that I'm doing now. Can you give me an example of that? Really going after some of my personal goals and deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long term. Yeah. I wish I had done that earlier. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 20 years ago I would have given myself the advice to continue with my schooling beyond what I did. And to be more discerning in my choices of interests. And to be more open to the individuals who I allow in my life. What are you most proud of in your life? Being a part of the family that I'm a part of. That's so good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'll see you next time. I didn't know if it went. No. Okay. Okay. Now you can move to the other computer where we have your contact information. Thanks for your time. Take care. I'll see you next time. Bye. We'll be right back.
