[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: I think...
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: I think there's a different type of organization.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00:

[00:03:25] SPEAKER_00: me and not true not honest not real um that that upsets me a lot
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_00: um i tend to just try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: i'll usually take a walk or something like that or just just
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head

[00:04:31] SPEAKER_00: discipline her and i think that's what i'm going to do and i'm going to do it
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_00: discipline her a little more on certain situations so i think different discipline is

[00:08:56] SPEAKER_00: What did you do?
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_00: you say? No, not really. I think he would describe me as a stand-up guy. I try to be
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_00: a good, loyal friend and an adult. I think he would describe me like that. School. Went

[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: Very loyal. I'm a hard worker. I think I am, to a certain extent, I'm just not that
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_00: average guy. I'm pretty much a different breed. I just carry myself and act a little
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_00: different from a normal guy. I don't know. Just how I was raised and how my dad was kind
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_00: of different. He didn't go within the crowd. I think I learned that from him a lot. It's
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_00: the same path I took. Yeah. A lot of things I regret. I regret a lot of decisions in my
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: life. Yeah. One, I actually let go of my family. I let go of my family. I let go of my family.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_00: A lady in my life go years ago that I felt was my soulmate. We had a big argument. One
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_00: thing led to another. We decided to take a break. Then that break, I started dating somebody
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_00: else. I told her I'm going to go my way and she go her way. I think that was a big, a bad
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_00: decision. A very bad decision. Yeah. Totally. I think I could have took a step back. I think
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: I could have gone back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_00: of being so upset and moving forward. I'm just upset. I tend to get upset and then my
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_00: thoughts get clouded. I need to think a little more when I'm upset. I don't know. I don't
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_00: know. I'm just experiencing time. Making up for your mistakes and being better about
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_00: different decisions after you made the mistakes.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_00: Think a little harder about situations.
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_00: The decisions that you make. Think a lot longer and harder before you make them. I think the
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_00: outcome will be a little different today.
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_00: My grandmother, she's always been a positive influence. She's a great black woman with
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_00: old school.
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_00: She's a great black woman. She's a great black woman. She's a great black woman. She's a
[00:13:16] SPEAKER_00: Mulan woman. She's the best.
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_00: 荊ей. I just had been living. So, I think I've added that to my life. She's a great
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_00: woman.
[00:13:41] SPEAKER_00: And baseball. And yeah.
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_00: I was a pretty good player. I was a pretty good athlete growing up. I was one of the
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_00: top. And that started a future in athletics and that's what I wanted to do. So I accomplished
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_00: my goals. At the time it was a great thing and still is a great thing. It's a great accomplishment
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_00: in my life. Accomplishments, being able to, if I have a goal or something I'm supposed
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: to do that week or that day and I accomplish it, it always puts me in a good mood. Or getting
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_00: my job done and the way I'm doing it.
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_00: Being able to do it in a timely fashion always puts me in a good mood.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_00: Being a positive role model right now for younger kids that's in our sports academy
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_00: program. I think as I got older the thought process and the way I look at life has totally
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_00: changed.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_00: I think a lot of kids can look up to me that I deal with now and say that's somebody that
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_00: is a positive influence in my life.
