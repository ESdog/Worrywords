[00:09:36] SPEAKER_02: My relationship with my family, with my father is not so great.
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_02: My parents were divorced when I was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life,
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_02: you know, forever.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_02: Mostly out.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_02: So that's, it's not fantastic but it's something that I'm used to.
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_02: So it's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then I lost him.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_02: But it's still, it's still, it's still not the best situation.
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I still wish that could be remedied somehow.
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_02: So there's good and bad relationships in my family.
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_02: There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_02: Someone that's been there for me since I was very, very young and has always been just incredible and I love her so much.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_02: What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_02: 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so I don't have to work so hard now.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_02: Is there anything you regret?
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_02: I regret exactly that.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_02: I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been, it's been, it's been a lot of work.
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_02: And it's been much harder.
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_02: I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_02: That was probably a great time, one of the best times in the last few weeks.
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about your kids.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_02: And they're great kids.
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_02: Do you find it easy to be a parent?
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_02: I think it's challenging.
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_02: It is more difficult because they're stepchildren so there are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_02: and how much not to get involved.
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_02: But we're very lucky because they are really good kids.
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_02: They do tend to fight a lot.
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_02: But it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it.
[00:12:35] SPEAKER_02: That's good.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_02: What are some ways that you're different than your parents?
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_02: I make a conscious effort not to punish them.
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_02: I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_02: I was screamed at a lot as a child.
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_02: And it was really difficult.
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_02: So I make sure not to do that.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_02: What are you most proud of in your life?
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_02: I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to try to be a better person.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_02: I've traveled the world and live in other places, many, many other places around the country and around the world.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_02: And the fact that I've learned several languages.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_02: And the fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends.
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_02: I think I've asked everything I need to.
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_00: Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.

So it's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then I lost him. But it's still, it's still, it's still not the best situation. I mean, I still wish that could be remedied somehow. Yeah. So there's good and bad relationships in my family. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Someone that's been there for me since I was very, very young and has always been just incredible and I love her so much. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so I don't have to work so hard now. Okay. Is there anything you regret? I regret exactly that. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been, it's been, it's been a lot of work. And it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy. That was probably a great time, one of the best times in the last few weeks. Tell me about your kids. Yeah. And they're great kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren so there are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. But we're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot. But it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child. And it was really difficult. So I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to try to be a better person. I've traveled the world and live in other places, many, many other places around the country and around the world. And the fact that I've learned several languages. And the fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye.
