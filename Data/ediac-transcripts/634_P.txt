[00:00:00] SPEAKER_00: Okay. Hold on.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_01: And when she's done, she should say goodbye.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_01: But if...
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_03: I'm doing good, thanks.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_04: I'm from Los Angeles, here in California.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_04: I love the beach, I love the weather, and I love all the things there are to do here.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_04: I don't like the smog, I don't like the traffic, and that might be, those might be the things at the top of my list.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_04: We travel a little bit, yes.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_04: What do you enjoy about traveling?
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_04: I'd like to hear about one of your trips.
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_04: A couple years ago, we took the kids to Acapulco for Thanksgiving.
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_04: And it's not normally a time of the year that we travel, but we thought we'd try something different.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_04: And it was a great experience for them.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_04: We did all kinds of things that we normally would not have done.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_04: So it was an opportunity to sort of stretch our horizons and experience some new things.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_04: And we actually had a really great time.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_04: What's one of your most memorable experiences?
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_04: One of my most memorable experiences in terms of travel, I guess, was the time that my luggage got lost in Puerto Vallarta.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_04: And I spent the week wearing my husband's shorts and t-shirt.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_04: What did you study at school?
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_04: I went to fashion school for two years.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_04: And then I went to college.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_04: 
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_04: Then after that, I got my bachelor's.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_04: What do you do now?
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_04: Now I'm a real estate agent that has nothing to do with the subjects that I studied in college,
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_04: but it's a great career nonetheless.
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_04: What's your dream job?
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_04: My dream job would still be in real estate,
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_04: but it might be such that I have the financial means that I can just do it because I love it.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_04: I love helping people secure their first property,
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_04: so I work with a lot of first-time buyers.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_04: It's their foyer into wealth management.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_04: I like educating people on the process.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_04: I would probably still want to be in the business of real estate.
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_04: I might actually delve more into income property ownership,
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_04: but it would still be something in real estate.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_04: Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_04: Definitely more outgoing.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_04: Tell me about your relationship with your family.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_04: I have a good relationship.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_04: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fish Tank screensaver.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_04: Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_04: What do you do to relax?
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_04: I work out to relax.
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_04: Usually three to five times a week.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_04: I work out in the mornings and it does help to manage stress.
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_04: In real estate and being a mom, there is lots of stress in my life.
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_04: How are you controlling your temper?
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_04: Getting better at it, not the best at it.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_04: I tend to be very outwardly with my emotions
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_04: and am learning to
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_04: try to check them at the door a lot more than I used to.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_04: So, I'm a work in progress.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_04: When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_04: It probably was, the person was probably my husband.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_04: And the timeframe may have been a month or so ago.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_04: And quite honestly, I don't remember what it was about.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_04: So that tells you that it was probably something that was not even important.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_04: Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_04: I wish that I would argue with my husband less, especially in front of our kids.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_04: What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_04: I feel guilty about arguing with my husband in front of my kids.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_04: It's something that they should be apart from and separate from.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_04: And not even be included in that.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_04: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_04: It was probably the decision to let my daughter move forward with the heart surgery
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_04: that the doctor said that she needed.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_04: But it was a very scary time and place for us.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_04: But we moved forward with it.
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_04: It was a decision that I did not make alone.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_04: I made it along with my husband.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_04: Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_04: An event that I wish I could erase from my memory would be as a child being touched inappropriately by a family member.
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_04: I wish I could erase it.
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_04: 
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_04: Have you ever served in the military?
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_04: No.
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_04: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_04: I've been feeling fine.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_04: Tell me more about that.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_04: I've been feeling fine this summer.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_04: The work stress is still there, but my kids are out of school.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_04: So our household is a lot more relaxed.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_04: My son is actually in Sacramento for the past couple of weeks.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_04: So it's just my husband and my daughter and I.
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_04: And we're sort of taking a little bit of a laid back approach to summer before our vacation comes up.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_04: Have you ever studied changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_04: No.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_04: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_04: Pretty easy.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_04: Over the last two to three weeks, I think there was one night where I had so much on my mind I did find it hard to fall asleep.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_04: But in general, I do sleep well.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_04: The workouts help with that as well.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_04: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_04: Just sort of not as social, a little more quiet.

[00:09:54] SPEAKER_04: When was the last time you felt really happy?
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_04: Today or yesterday.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_04: Just the ability to be blessed to wake up every day and have an opportunity to do something.
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_04: 
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_04: Just the opportunity to make the best day that I can.
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_04: That's a blessing.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_04: So I'm happy about that every day.
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_04: That's great.
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_04: Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_04: My mother is definitely a positive influence in my life.

[00:10:32] SPEAKER_04: She's a very spiritual woman and always seems to lead me or point me in the right direction.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_04: How would your best friend describe you?
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_04: My best friend actually passed away, so I will use my husband, who is a really good friend actually.
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_04: And at this point he is my best friend.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_04: And he would probably describe me as someone who lives my life passionately,
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_04: who is very dedicated and loyal.
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_04: And who wears her emotions on her sleeve.
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_04: That's good.
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_04: Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_04: On Saturday, my husband, my daughter and I just, we were in Burbank handling some business.

[00:11:26] SPEAKER_04: And my daughter asked if we could go to Sherman Oaks Galleria to hang out.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_04: And it was not something that was my choice.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_04: But it was just really nice to go.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_04: And I was able to be able to hang out in a really casual environment and do something that she wanted to do.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_04: And that really pleased her.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_04: And we went shopping and we had a really good time.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_04: But ordinarily I would have never chose that activity.
