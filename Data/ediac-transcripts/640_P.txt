[00:04:53] SPEAKER_02: What do you do to relax?
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_02: I usually watch a movie or go to the movies.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_02: I go to the park. I have a small dog, so I like taking him around the block.

[00:05:46] SPEAKER_02: We were with a big group of people and we were just trying to decide where to go.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_02: One of my friends was pretty adamant about one place.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_02: She said it was unappealing to the rest of the group.
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_02: It got a little confrontational, but everything worked out in the end.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_02: I think the passing of my mom's dad.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_02: I wish I would have been a little more loving and emotional to my mom about it.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_02: It was a very difficult time for her.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_02: I should have been there a little bit more than I was.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_02: What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_02: I feel guilty about just not being as loving and caring to my parents.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_02: They've done a lot for me and provided a lot.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_02: I don't always really show my appreciation to them as much as I wish I should.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_02: I'm not a very good person.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_02: The hardest decision I've ever...
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_02: Something that I wish was erased would certainly be when I was pulled over for a date.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_02: It was a very embarrassing moment, but I wish that had never happened.
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_02: Do you have any memories of how you have been feeling?

[00:07:59] SPEAKER_02: It's been a little bit difficult on all of us.
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_02: We're all spread out around the country, so it's tough.
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_02: We can't really be together in person.
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_02: It makes it difficult.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry to hear that.

[00:08:23] SPEAKER_02: Just recently.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_02: I think I've been a little more bummed out and down a little bit more than normal.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_02: I'm sure it'll turn around soon, but some of these things just take time to heal.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_02: Tell me more about that.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_02: Whenever you lose someone close to you in a family, it's very difficult for everyone.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_02: Different people show their emotions differently.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_02: For me, I tend to keep a lot of it in.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_02: It'd be a little more beneficial if I was able to express it to someone more,
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_02: but I don't really feel comfortable doing that all the time.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_02: Hopefully things get better.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_02: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_02: It's very difficult because I work a lot of strange hours too.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_02: I'm up working late.

[00:09:27] SPEAKER_02: If I'm not in a set routine, it makes it a little more difficult.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_02: I usually get a decent amount of sleep as often as possible.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_02: I usually don't have too much trouble in that sense.
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_02: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_02: If I don't sleep well, I'm usually a little bit more irritable, more grumpy.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_02: Smaller things can set me off.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_02: I have certain techniques to relax a little bit more.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_02: Whenever that happens, I'm usually able to handle myself appropriately.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_02: Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_02: Alright. Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you felt really happy?
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_02: The last time was probably about three weeks ago when I was in Las Vegas visiting some friends and had some other friends come out to visit that I hadn't seen in a while.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_02: That was a fun happy time for the weekend.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_02: I'm happy to be able to go out and do things.
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_02: That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_02: My dad has always been a good role model to me. Professional and always been there regardless of what I've been going through.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_02: I certainly look up to him and appreciate everything he's done for me.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_02: How would your best friend describe you?
[00:11:21] SPEAKER_02: He would describe me as being pretty social, outgoing, but a little bit more shy and reserved.
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_02: Friendly, caring, honest, and reliable.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_02: That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.

[00:11:48] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_02: Completing a big project for someone. I built a large website that had been a big project for a while and it's been taking up a lot of my time.
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_02: Finally getting that finished and taken care of was a big relief and a weight off my shoulders.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_02: Nice. What are you most proud of in your life?
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_02: Most proud of my family.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_02: They've always been there for me. I've gone through a lot of tough times when I was younger and they've always been there to support me and that's really meant a lot.
[00:12:28] SPEAKER_02: That's really kept me going. I've got great friends around me as well, but family first. They've always been there when I've needed them.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_02: Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_02: Goodbye.
