[00:11:27] SPEAKER_01: Even though you don't enter the situation, the training up to that point is, is safe.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: And then all of a sudden you have to use what you were trained in a safe environment and

[00:12:43] SPEAKER_01: Why did you stop?
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_01: Um, it wasn't, it wasn't really an issue with me anymore.
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_01: Um, I'm coping with it well and, and it's, like I said, time heals everything.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_01: I'm, I do believe that.
