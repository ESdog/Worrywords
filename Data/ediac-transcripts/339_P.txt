[00:03:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_01: What is being cheated on in the first place?
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_01: There are people that think that people are baikers or being stealing things.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_01: Different people think that they dick with me.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_01: Or they teleport people away from the home.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: that would make the situation better.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_01: Um, come up with alternate plans so I won't be annoyed.
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_01: Um, pretty good.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: Um, I may have had an argument.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_01: A few weeks ago.
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_01: Um, just about timeliness.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_01: Like meeting on time and showing up on time.
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_01: And it was actually last, uh, Monday.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_01: Uh, mm-hmm.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_01: No.
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_01: No.
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_01: Um, to just be cautious of people's intentions.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_01: Mm-hmm.
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_01: And to listen really well.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_01: Because people usually tell you what their intentions are without even, um, realizing it.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_01: How would your best friend describe you?
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_01: Um, a good listener.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_01: Patient.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_01: Um, fun, loving.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_01: Generous.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_01: Um, depressed sometimes.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_01: Um, but generally a good person.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_01: That's good.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_01: Have you ever served in the military?
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_01: No, I have not.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_01: Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_01: How long ago were you diagnosed?
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_01: Um, within a year and a half ago.
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_01: Did you think you had a problem before you found out?
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_01: Um, I just knew that I often thought about situations that, um, happened in the past
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_01: and kind of blamed the situation for my future.
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_01: And I'll...
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_01: Have you ever heard about something?
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_01: Um, certain settings.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: Can you tell me about that?
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_01: Um, if I...
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_01: Um, see certain types of individuals in certain settings, it just reminds me of when I was younger, when things happened and changed my future plans.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: So, I, um, try to...
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_01: I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_01: But now I feel like I, um, just handle things better as far as...
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_01: Um, being in the similar settings with similar people.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_01: I just...
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_01: I, um, handle those things better.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_01: That's good.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_01: Do you still go to therapy now?
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_01: I do.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_01: Does going to therapy help you?
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_01: Um, I'd like to believe that it does.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_01: What sort of changes have you noticed in your going to therapy?
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_01: I don't worry as much.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_01: How has saving their life affected you?
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_01: Um, it's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues, um, relieves me of the tension of, um, holding them inside.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_01: So, that's how it's helped me.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: How hard is that?
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: At first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_01: But now it, um, it actually is good because I know that when things are occurring, um, if I'm able to, um, communicate about them with a certain individual, it, um, relieves me of the stress of, of, uh, trying to figure out what to do.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: I, um, I'm able to, um, communicate about everything alone.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_01: And oftentimes, um, by speaking about the issues, it, um, allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because I'm hearing myself speak of the issue.
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_01: What got you to the hospital?
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: Um, I was diagnosed with depression.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_01: And, um, my doctor felt that I should probably see the therapist.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_01: So, I went to the doctor.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: And, um, I got a little bit better.
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: Are you happy you did that?
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_01: Um, I am.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_01: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_01: It depends.
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_01: Um, if I'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do, I often try to plan things.
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_01: And if I'm planning things, it affects my sleep.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_01: I might wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_01: So, sometimes I'm not able to do that.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_01:
