[00:01:29] SPEAKER_00: And...
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: I think that if you have a hobby,
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_00: you could always find a large group of people
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_00: that are interested in the same hobbies you have.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_00: What are some things you don't really like about LA?

[00:01:46] SPEAKER_00: it's pretty transient.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_00: They come and go, and it's kind of difficult as far as if you,
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_00: you know, trusting people in the business world has been difficult.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_00: How often do you go back to your hometown?

[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: Business.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: Acting.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: That kind of thing.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: What do you do now?
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm working on becoming a professional poker player.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: And I left the stock brokerage industry successfully
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_00: to do financial trading, stock options, futures,
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_00: that kind of stuff.

[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: I vent.
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: Ruminate over the same situation over and over again.
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your humbler?
