[00:00:13] SPEAKER_00: Hi, I'm Ellie.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: Thanks for coming in today.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_00: I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_00: I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_00: I'll ask a few questions to get us started.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: And please feel free to tell me anything.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: Your answers are totally confidential.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_00: Are you okay with this?
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: So, how are you doing today?
[00:00:38] SPEAKER_01: I'm doing great. How about you?
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_01: Where are you from originally?
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_01: Born in the US. I was born in Orlando, Florida.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_01: Why'd you move to LA?
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_01: My parents. My dad had a lot of friends in Los Angeles, so we decided to move here.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_01: How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_01: It was pretty different.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_01: I mean, the place I was before was very, it was a very small town.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_01: You probably won't even notice it on the map.
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_01: So it was a big learning experience because, you know, the schools were a lot larger and different cultures and ethnicities.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_01: So it was a unique experience.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_01: How often do you go back to your hometown?
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_01: Last time I've been back was probably about five years ago.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_01: How does it compare to LA?
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_01: Definitely different. My aunt, she lives in, again, she lives in a small town.
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_01: So if you want to go to a movie theater, you have to drive out at least an hour.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_01: Or if you want to go to a mall, it's an hour drive.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_01: So it's complete opposite of Los Angeles.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_01: What are some things you really like about LA?
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_01: The convenience. Everything I could possibly want is here.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_01: The weather is great. Shopping. A lot of friends here. Sports.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_01: LA is just kind of like the perfect area, you know.
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: You know, I want to live here kind of for the rest of my life, actually.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_01: What are some things you don't really like about LA?
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_01: The big thing would probably be traffic.
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_01: I mean, wherever you go, there's going to be traffic, whether you're on the 405 or the 101.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: It's just traffic. It can kill like two hours in your day, which is huge.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_01: Do you travel a lot?
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, quite a bit. For personal and for business, I travel.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_01: Usually overseas or domestically, I travel. And I enjoy it a lot.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_01: What do you enjoy about traveling?
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: Seeing different places, different areas, meeting new people.
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_01: Eating different kinds of food. Being able to sightsee and tour if I have a day or two free.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_01: It's just experiencing, having new experiences just enriches my life.
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_01: What did you study at school?
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_01: Computers. And I also did English as well.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_01: Are you still working in that?
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_01: Yes, I am.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_01: What do you do now?
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_01: I work in IT.
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_01: In an IT department at a semiconductor company.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_01: What's your dream job?
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_01: Probably working for Apple.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_01: Since I pretty much own everything they have.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_01: It would be great to work for Apple.
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_01: Do you consider yourself an introvert?
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_01: It depends. There are times when it's good to be alone.
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_01: But for the most part, I consider myself an outgoing social person.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_01: What are some things that make you really mad?
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: Nothing too much. I guess if you kind of make a promise and you break it several times.
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_01: I might get a little bit annoyed. But I don't think I would get really mad.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_01: What do you do when you're annoyed?
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: Good question. I'd probably say I tend to eat a little bit more.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: Just kind of keep my mind off of it a little bit.
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_01: But usually it doesn't last that long.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_01: I tend to eat out a little bit more.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_01: More kind of like maybe junk food or something.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_01: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_01: I think I'm pretty good. I rarely get mad.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_01: And if I do, it doesn't really last that long.
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_01: So I think I'm pretty good at controlling my temper.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_01: Again, I really don't get angry.
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_01: So it's not really an issue for me.
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_01: When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about?
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_01: I'd say during the elections.
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_01: We were talking about President Obama and Mitt Romney and who would be the best fit for the next presidency.
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_01: That kind of got a little bit heated.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_01: But it was more for fun's sake than anything else.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_01: But it was an interesting conversation.
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_01: What do you do to relax?
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_01: I like to eat out a lot.

[00:07:04] SPEAKER_01: So that's great.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_01: And I thought it was going to cost me something extra on the side.
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_01: But the service advisor waived it.

[00:07:40] SPEAKER_01: Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_01: I'd probably say my best friend.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_01: He's kind of helped me out and I helped him out as well.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: So it's been kind of a great learning experience developing our friendship.
