[00:02:19] SPEAKER_00: The traffic. There's a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: than, more distant and unfriendly than other places.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_00: I was a history major. No. I do demonstrations in high end supermarkets. To be a screenwriter.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_00: That's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. It's hard because I don't, I don't
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_00: always maintain focus and motivation. A lot of other things distract me.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: How did you decide to do that?
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: I was, I've always been interested in films ever since I was a child. And I just
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_00: always, you know, was writing and had an active imagination.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_00: Do you travel a lot?
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: I've, I've been traveling a lot. I've been traveling a lot. I've been traveling a lot.
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_00: In the last, probably, almost ten years I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well,
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_00: I've always traveled, even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So yes.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: What do you enjoy about traveling?
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_00: Seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am. Seeing how they live.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_00: And taking in the sights.
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: I'd love to hear about on your trips.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_00: I went to Kenya. That was really fun. I had a good spend. The city is amazing. And my
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_00: That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on, on the safari and just going
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_00: Are you happy to do that?
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, it's one of the great experiences of my life.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_00: And I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called Sharm el Sheikh which
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_00: to believe that Egypt would but it was just amazing.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: I didn't go scuba diving, I went snorkeling.
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_00: Nice.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: What do you do to relax?
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_00: What do I do to relax?
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_00: I like to listen to music.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_00: Watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of whatever might be on my mind.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_00: I do meditate every day.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_00: I like to take walks in nature, that's always calming, especially down by the ocean.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_00: What do you do when you're annoyed?
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: I like to take a walk.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: A lot of times I'll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something I've recently
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: learned how to do which is very helpful.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_00: And also since I meditate I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_00: What are some things that make you really mad?
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_00: Some things that make me really mad.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: I guess think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_00: to be that way that we could all get along and make the world better.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: What are some things that make you really mad?
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_00: I guess think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_00: to be that way that we could all get along and make the world better.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film and I didn't think it
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: was done very well.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: We had a fun argument about the movie.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: That just happened yesterday so that's on my mind.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_00: Is there anything else you want to say?
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: Is there anything I regret?
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: Is there anything I regret?
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_00: Yeah there have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_00: them.
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_00: Like what?
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: Certain jobs.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_00: You know when I first got to Los Angeles I had an opportunity to become a grip and I
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_00: probably should have pursued that.
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_00: How did you decide to do that?
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: How did I decide to do that?
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: I don't really understand the question.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_00: Let's come back to that later.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_00: What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way.
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_00: I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_00: And no matter what.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: You know how you feel.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: You know you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do.
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever served in the military?
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:08:08] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been diagnosed with depression?
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: No but I've been depressed in my life.
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_00: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_00: For the most part I've been feeling good.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I feel a little blue.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: I think sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down.
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_00: But I can usually get out of it pretty quickly.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: Are you triggered by something?
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes financial concerns.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes an opportunity.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: How do I explain it?
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: Financial is one way that if I had made another decision I might have more money or my life would be different.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior?
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_00: Not really.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_00: I mean I feel pretty much the same.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_00: Okay. What got you to seek help?
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_00: What got me to seek help for...
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: Let's come back to that.
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: Okay. How has being in therapy affected you?
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_00: Well generally talking to someone has helped when I did do that.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_00: That's good. How easy is it for you to get a good result?
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_00: Pretty easy. I don't have a problem sleeping.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: What do you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_00: Usually I'm grumpy.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_00: So if I don't sleep well I feel tired and irritable.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_00: I see what you mean. How would your best friend have grabbed you?
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_00: How would my best friend describe me?
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_00: That's a good question.
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_00: Well I'm definitely friendly and outgoing.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_00: A little bit secretive.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_00: Probably that I should be...
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_00: They'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: And maybe a little happier.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: Do you consider yourself an introvert?
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: I think...
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_00: It's tough. It depends.
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: So that means that I have to spend time alone.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: And then when I come out of that I'm extroverted.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_00: So I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other.
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_00: It all depends on the situation.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_00: And my mood.
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_00: What would you say are some of your best qualities?
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_00: My best qualities...
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm caring.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm intelligent.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm funny.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: I'm outgoing.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_00: I have a likeable personality.
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_00: You know people have said that.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_00: I'm engaging but not oppressive or overly engaging.
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_00: There's sort of a cool detachment.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_00: And creative.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_00: Intuitive.
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_00: There's some of this that have happened in your life.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you felt really happy?
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_00: Last time I felt really happy?
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_00: I woke up this morning.

[00:12:50] SPEAKER_00: And feeling the sun, powerful sun on my back.

[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: Almost beyond like human in a way.
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: Just more in touch with like everything.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_00: The universe.

Sometimes an opportunity. How do I explain it? Financial is one way that if I had made another decision I might have more money or my life would be different.

How would your best friend have grabbed you? How would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. Well I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be... They'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals. And maybe a little happier. Do you consider yourself an introvert? I think... It's tough. It depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write. So that means that I have to spend time alone. And then when I come out of that I'm extroverted. So I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation. And my mood. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities... I think I'm caring.
