[00:01:11] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's funny.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_00: Because I've just always thought that the conveying of emotions or feelings,
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_00: uh, be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

[00:02:08] SPEAKER_00: Uh, that the idea of certain, you know, medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent, you know, topic.
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_00: Very thought upon.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: And I feel that Los Angeles' deep culture is, um,
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: why I stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to, there's a lot to gain from the different communities, if you understand.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

[00:02:43] SPEAKER_00: Um, well, the, the human mentality here is, um, is very, is very hectic, very chaotic.
[00:02:56] SPEAKER_00: You know, a lot due to the vehicle, the car, the freeway, and this idea that we're on a grind, you know, this, yeah, it's, it's a very, it's, it's very hectic, um, atmosphere, human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting, loving community to help each other out kind of thing.

[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: It's more like, what do I, it's, it's just more like I, I enjoy not being, uh, trapped in this city with all these, uh, made up ties and restraints.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_00: I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this, uh, faux image, you know, man made image that it is here.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_00: So I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: Thanks.

[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: Well, I kind of recently last year went to Los Banos, Central California area.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: And although it wasn't that far from L.A., it was completely different energy.
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_00: There was no phones.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_00: There was no Wi-Fi.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_00: There was no TV.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: There was sanity.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_00: There was relative sanity in the sense that people weren't deluded in getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_00: People were just raw, real and hiking and chilling.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_00: I was working at a hot spring resort.
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_00: And I just got to breathe and hike.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_00: And farm and do a lot of carpentry.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_00: How hard is that?
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: Um, not hard.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: You don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: So it wasn't...
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: What made you decide to do that?
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: I guess, uh...
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_00: I don't know what I described about this.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: I just wanted to, uh...
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_00: Get out of here and...
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_00: Kinda...
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_00: Just get out of here, really.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_00: And just experience the real...
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_00: The real deal.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_00: What did you study at school?
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_00: Um, well...
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_00: Currently I'm studying, um...
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_00: Currently I'm studying physical therapy.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: I'm about to become licensed massage therapist.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_00: But before that...
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_00: Kinda cool.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: But before that I was going to...
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: For music composition.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: So I was just writing scores for films, animations, dance productions, theater productions.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: Stuff like that.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_00: It was cool.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_00: It was fun.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_00: Trippy.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_00: Very trippy.
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: But it was cool.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_00: But I had to leave that because...
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: Tuition...
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_00: And I had to leave them for like six weeks.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: Up to...
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_00: You know, going up to like fifty thousand a year for like a four year BFA.
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_00: Is, uh...
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: Not...
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: Not the deal.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: Not trying to trap myself with these, uh, chains of federal loans.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: So yeah.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: That sucks.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_00: Hey.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_00: That's not a good word.
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_00: Sucks.
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_00: What's your dream job?
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_00: Dream...
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: Job...
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_00: It's...
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_00: It's not a good word.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_00: My dream job would be anything that I can do to alleviate these metropolitan cities from the nightmare that they've been put in.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: My dream is to alleviate the nightmare. My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_00: And with physical therapy and artistic expression, I've got some great ideas.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_00: That's good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes when I'm feeling happy, I'm more outgoing.
[00:08:25] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I turn on this vegetarian screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_00: What do you do to relax?
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: I thought that was really funny. What I do to relax is kind of breathe it out, chill, maybe make a smoothie or some tea.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to go bike riding. Right?
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_00: Pretty good, I guess. I haven't yelled in a long time.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_00: Well, it wasn't arguing. I don't really argue much. I just like to say my opinion and have it be understood.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_00: I don't like the person I'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood.
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_00: So the last time that happened was, I guess, yesterday, chilling in downtown with a friend from New York.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_00: And we were talking about riding. And basically, we were not arguing, but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so yesterday.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_00: So, I'm going to give you a chance to ask you a question.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_00: What's something that you feel guilty about?
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: Hmm. Guilty. That's tough, I haven't had that feeling in a long time, guilt. What about you? What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: Why don't we talk about that later?
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_00: Mm hmm. Okay.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:11:05] SPEAKER_00: Maybe the time...
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_00: She was going to school. I was taking the year off, and I was just kind of hanging around.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_00: But we had an apartment together with another friend.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_00: And it didn't turn out...
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_00: You know, not all...
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: Nothing turns out as it's thought to be.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: And that's kind of the beautiful thing about it.
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: But this one turned out a little...
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_00: A little different. Actually, quite different than I thought it would be.
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_00: I thought it was funny.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: But yeah, it ended up me leaving before the lease ended.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_00: And it actually ended up with us separating.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_00: But that's something I wish...
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: Maybe I handled a little...
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_00: A little more...
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_00: Thoughtfully.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_00: The hardest decision?
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_00: Huh.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_00: Maybe...
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_00: Maybe not the hardest.
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_00: But a hard decision I had to make was leaving school.
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_00: Dropping my...
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_00: Continuation of achieving a BFA.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that could have been the hardest.
[00:12:31] SPEAKER_00: What made you decide to do that?
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_00: It's just...
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_00: I don't...
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_00: I mean, of course, money.
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_00: Money's the motto.
[00:12:42] SPEAKER_00: Money's a big issue.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_00: Tuition hikes going around the whole nation.
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_00: Not a fan of that.
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_00: Not a fan of...
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: Not a fan to support that.
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_00: But...
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons...
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_00: Why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around.
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_00: And, um...
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_00: But another reason why I decided to leave...
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: I had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was...
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_00: Also because, um...
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_00: Art Institute, you know, that's a...
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_00: It's a funny idea in itself already.
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_00: And basically, I was a musician.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_00: Being taught by a musician...
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_00: To...
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_00: To make music...
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_00: And same with, you know, all the...
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_00: All the dancers or the theater students, you know.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: Getting taught dance.
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_00: To...
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_00: To a dancer, from a dancer.
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_00: How to dance, you know.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_00: And it's just, um...
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's just not...
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_00: Quite as artistic as...
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_00: I thought art would be.
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_00: Art...
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_00: Art comes from somewhere...
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_00: Somewhere sweet and deep and purple.
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_00: And not...
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_00: Not from out there, you know.
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_00: So, yeah.
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_00: If I...
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_00: If I, um...
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_00: It's kind of easy.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it depends, you know.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_00: If I remember to make some chamomile tea.
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_00: Or if I...
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_00: Remember to breathe.
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_00: And go through my mantras.
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_00: Or...
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_00: Remember to do my pre...
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_00: Like, dream therapy work.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_00: Then I can get into it real nice.
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: But if I just get deluded with all my thought.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_00: Then it takes a long time until I...
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_00: Remember to breathe.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_00: How do you cope with that?
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_00: Um, yeah.
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_00: Basically, just what I said.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_00: Just breathing.
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_00: Or, you know, if I'm hanging out with friends.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_00: Coming home late.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_00: And if I...
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_00: Get the lucky chance...
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_00: To be, uh...
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_00: Medicated.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_00: From, you know, a nice...
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_00: A nice indica.
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_00: Then...
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_00: It really does.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_00: You know, indica does put me down pretty nice.
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_00: Pretty drowsy.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: So...
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: A lot of things.
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_00: Breathing.
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_00: You know.
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_00: You know, medical herbs.
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_00: Like chamomile.
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_00: And cannabis.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_00: And...
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_00: Just, uh...
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_00: Going...
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_00: Just relieving myself of...
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_00: Bad...
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_00: Bad juju.
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh.
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:15:28] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever studied...
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_00: Any of the jujube or...
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_00: Toxins?
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_00: Mmm...
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_00: Mmm...
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_00: Mmm...
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_00: I...
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_00: No, I guess not.
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_00: I can't think of something now.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_00: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_00: I've been feeling...
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_00: Kind of like...
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_00: Kind of like this.
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_00: Kind of just cruising...
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_00: On a...
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_00: On a gray line.
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_00: But it's a nice gray.
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_00: It's a really nice hue.
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_00: Some people wouldn't like this.
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_00: But I really like that.
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: And it's, uh...
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_00: It's stable.
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_00: It's comfortable.
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been diagnosed with jujube?
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_00: Mmm...
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_00: No, I haven't.
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_00: Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_00: Not by a certified medical professional, no.
[00:16:34] SPEAKER_00: But...
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_00: No, I haven't.
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I just think...
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_00: Like the whole...
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_00: You know, like you said, PTSD, depression, and...
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: You know, other...
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_00: You know, mental instabilities.
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_00: I think...
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_00: Everybody is depressed.
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: I think everybody is overjoyed.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_00: I think everybody's angry.
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_00: I think everybody's shy.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: Everybody's social.
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_00: All at the same time.
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's just...
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_00: Different days.
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_00: Different, you know, variants.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_00: Different floats.
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_00: Different boats.
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: You know, different...
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_00: Waves.
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_00: Different swells.
[00:17:09] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, I think...
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_00: I'm depressed.
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm really happy.
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm really angry.
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm really friendly.
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_00: You know, all that.
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_00: But just on different variants.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_00: Different floats.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_00: Really happy?
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I feel really happy a lot.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_00: And I feel really sad a lot.
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_00: But really happy was, I guess...
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_00: Maybe this morning when I was just biking over here.
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_00: Just enjoying the sun.
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_00: Enjoying the breeze.
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_00: Biking.
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_00: That's great.
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is.
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_00: How would your best friend describe you?
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_00: Well, I have a lot of best friends.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_00: And they describe me all pretty differently.
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_00: But underlying that same idea.
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_00: That maybe I'm just...
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_00: Maybe, in a nutshell, just kind of Aquarius.
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_00: I guess.
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_00: What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_00: Well...
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm 21.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_00: So 20 years ago...
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_00: I would have told myself to keep being a baby.
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_00: Stay young.
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_00: And don't lose sight.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_00: You know, don't stop listening.
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_00: Keep letting things happen.
[00:18:40] SPEAKER_00: Don't make them happen.
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_00: Be...
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_00: Be a beautiful baby.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_00: That's what I would have told myself.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_00: Or...
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_00: Be a beautiful baby.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_00: What would you say a community has followed you?
[00:19:02] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_00: Well, I guess recently what has been shown to me...
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_00: Through me, by me...
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_00: Is my ability to work with others.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: And I'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint.
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_00: I've been collaborating a lot with artists.
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: Working on...
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_00: A lot of different...
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_00: Mediums.
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_00: Mixed media projects.
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_00: And...
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_00: I'm really comfortable with it.
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_00: And with other peoples.
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_00: And melting our ideas together.
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:19:39] SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_00: What do you love most about it in your life?
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_00: That's a weird question.
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: Like...
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_00: Like, that's trying to make me single out...
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_00: The...
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_00: You know, one moment that I...
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_00: Today reflect upon and think about.
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_00: Like it's some past glory that I'm...
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_00: Not capable of fulfilling today.
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_00: So...
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_00: I think the proudest moment of my life is right now.
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_00: Chilling.
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_00: Hanging with you.

==================================================
FULL TRANSCRIPTION:

 This is kind of fun. Did you need to do like a mic check or are we good? We're good. So now she's going to ask me some things. Okay. Once she's done, that's the second. Cool. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I've been created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get it started. And please feel free to call me anytime. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah, I'm totally fine. It'd be confidential or not, you know. My words are everybody's. Get wild. That's good. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good. Hanging out. Nice weather. I just had a recent change of feeling just now. Looking at you, the digital you that I'm seeing. I don't know. Yeah, it's funny. Why? Because I've just always thought that the conveying of emotions or feelings, uh, be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself. Yeah. I see what you mean. Where are you from originally? I think you see what I mean. I'm from, um, born and raised in Los Angeles, Venice area. Mar Vista, specifically. Um, that's where I'm from. Where is it? What are some of the things you really like about LA? Um, well, there's a lot more that I don't like, but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up. Uh, that the idea of certain, you know, medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent, you know, topic. Very thought upon. And I feel that Los Angeles' deep culture is, um, why I stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to, there's a lot to gain from the different communities, if you understand. Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Um, well, the, the human mentality here is, um, is very, is very hectic, very chaotic. You know, a lot due to the vehicle, the car, the freeway, and this idea that we're on a grind, you know, this, yeah, it's, it's a very, it's, it's very hectic, um, atmosphere, human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting, loving community to help each other out kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Well, I can't see your shoes. But, um, I love to travel. I do love hiking. I do love surfing, swimming, biking, riding, taking rides. Uh, I do love to travel, yeah. What do you enjoy about traveling? Um, from my travels, it's not like, well, I do enjoy a lot of things about travel, but, you know, I don't really like to travel. It's more like, what do I, it's, it's just more like I, I enjoy not being, uh, trapped in this city with all these, uh, made up ties and restraints. I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this, uh, faux image, you know, man made image that it is here. So I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is. Thanks. I'd love to hear about one of your friends. Would you? Okay. Okay. Well, I kind of recently last year went to Los Banos, Central California area. And although it wasn't that far from L.A., it was completely different energy. There was no phones. There was no Wi-Fi. There was no TV. There was sanity. There was relative sanity in the sense that people weren't deluded in getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence. People were just raw, real and hiking and chilling. I was working at a hot spring resort. And I just got to breathe and hike. And farm and do a lot of carpentry. Yeah. How hard is that? Um, not hard. You don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy. So it wasn't... What made you decide to do that? Um. I guess, uh... I don't know what I described about this. I just wanted to, uh... Get out of here and... Kinda... Just get out of here, really. And just experience the real... The real deal. Yeah. Okay. What did you study at school? Um, well... Currently I'm studying, um... Currently I'm studying physical therapy. Okay. Um... I'm about to become licensed massage therapist. But before that... Yeah. Kinda cool. But before that I was going to... Um... For music composition. So I was just writing scores for films, animations, dance productions, theater productions. Stuff like that. Yeah. It was cool. It was fun. Trippy. Very trippy. Um... But it was cool. But I had to leave that because... Tuition... And I had to leave them for like six weeks. Up to... You know, going up to like fifty thousand a year for like a four year BFA. Is, uh... Not... Not the deal. Not trying to trap myself with these, uh, chains of federal loans. So yeah. That sucks. Hey. That's not a good word. Sucks. What's your dream job? Um... Dream... Job... Um... It's... It's not a good word. My dream job would be anything that I can do to alleviate these metropolitan cities from the nightmare that they've been put in. My dream is to alleviate the nightmare. My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world. And with physical therapy and artistic expression, I've got some great ideas. That's good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Sometimes when I'm feeling happy, I'm more outgoing. Sometimes I turn on this vegetarian screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? I thought that was really funny. What I do to relax is kind of breathe it out, chill, maybe make a smoothie or some tea. I'm going to go bike riding. Right? Yeah. Yeah. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good, I guess. I haven't yelled in a long time. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Well, it wasn't arguing. I don't really argue much. I just like to say my opinion and have it be understood. I don't like the person I'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood. So the last time that happened was, I guess, yesterday, chilling in downtown with a friend from New York. And we were talking about riding. And basically, we were not arguing, but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written. Yeah, so yesterday. Okay. So, I'm going to give you a chance to ask you a question. What's something that you feel guilty about? Hmm. Guilty. That's tough, I haven't had that feeling in a long time, guilt. What about you? What's something you feel guilty about? Why don't we talk about that later? Mm hmm. Okay. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Hmm. Hmm. Maybe the time... She was going to school. I was taking the year off, and I was just kind of hanging around. But we had an apartment together with another friend. And it didn't turn out... You know, not all... Nothing turns out as it's thought to be. And that's kind of the beautiful thing about it. But this one turned out a little... A little different. Actually, quite different than I thought it would be. I thought it was funny. But yeah, it ended up me leaving before the lease ended. And it actually ended up with us separating. But that's something I wish... Maybe I handled a little... A little more... Thoughtfully. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision? Huh. Hmm. Maybe... Maybe not the hardest. But a hard decision I had to make was leaving school. Dropping my... Uh... Continuation of achieving a BFA. Yeah, that could have been the hardest. What made you decide to do that? Um... It's just... I don't... I mean, of course, money. Money's the motto. Money's a big issue. Tuition hikes going around the whole nation. Not a fan of that. Not a fan of... Not a fan to support that. But... Um... Yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons... Why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around. And, um... But another reason why I decided to leave... I had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was... Also because, um... Art Institute, you know, that's a... It's a funny idea in itself already. And basically, I was a musician. Being taught by a musician... To... To make music... And same with, you know, all the... All the dancers or the theater students, you know. Getting taught dance. To... To a dancer, from a dancer. How to dance, you know. And it's just, um... Yeah, it's just not... Quite as artistic as... I thought art would be. Art... Art comes from somewhere... Somewhere sweet and deep and purple. And not... Not from out there, you know. So, yeah. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Hmm. If I... If I, um... It's kind of easy. I mean, it depends, you know. If I remember to make some chamomile tea. Or if I... Remember to breathe. And go through my mantras. Or... Remember to do my pre... Like, dream therapy work. Then I can get into it real nice. Um... But if I just get deluded with all my thought. Then it takes a long time until I... Remember to breathe. Yeah. How do you cope with that? Um, yeah. Basically, just what I said. Just breathing. Or, you know, if I'm hanging out with friends. Coming home late. And if I... Get the lucky chance... To be, uh... Medicated. From, you know, a nice... A nice indica. Um... Then... It really does. You know, indica does put me down pretty nice. Pretty drowsy. So... A lot of things. Breathing. You know. You know, medical herbs. Uh... Like chamomile. And cannabis. And... Just, uh... Going... Just relieving myself of... Bad... Bad juju. Uh-huh. Okay. Have you ever studied... Any of the jujube or... Toxins? Mmm... Mmm... Mmm... I... No, I guess not. I can't think of something now. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling... Kind of like... Kind of like this. Kind of just cruising... On a... On a gray line. But it's a nice gray. It's a really nice hue. Um... Some people wouldn't like this. But I really like that. And it's, uh... It's stable. Yeah. It's comfortable. Yeah. Have you ever been diagnosed with jujube? Mmm... No. No, I haven't. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not by a certified medical professional, no. But... No, I haven't. Can you tell me about that? Um... Yeah, I mean, I just think... Like the whole... You know, like you said, PTSD, depression, and... You know, other... You know, mental instabilities. I think... Everybody is depressed. I think everybody is overjoyed. I think everybody's angry. I think everybody's shy. Everybody's social. All at the same time. You know, it's just... Different days. Different, you know, variants. Different floats. Different boats. You know, different... Waves. Different swells. Um... So, yeah, I think... I'm depressed. I think I'm really happy. I think I'm really angry. I think I'm really friendly. You know, all that. But just on different variants. Different floats. Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Really happy? Um... I mean, I feel really happy a lot. And I feel really sad a lot. But really happy was, I guess... Maybe this morning when I was just biking over here. Just enjoying the sun. Enjoying the breeze. Biking. That's great. Yeah, it is. How would your best friend describe you? Um... Well, I have a lot of best friends. And they describe me all pretty differently. But underlying that same idea. That maybe I'm just... Maybe, in a nutshell, just kind of Aquarius. I guess. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um... Well... Well, I'm 21. So 20 years ago... I would have told myself to keep being a baby. Uh... Stay young. And don't lose sight. You know, don't stop listening. Keep letting things happen. Don't make them happen. Be... Be a beautiful baby. That's what I would have told myself. Or... Yeah. Be a beautiful baby. Okay. What would you say a community has followed you? Um... Um... Well, I guess recently what has been shown to me... Uh... Through me, by me... Is my ability to work with others. And I'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint. I've been collaborating a lot with artists. Working on... A lot of different... Uh... Mediums. Mixed media projects. And...
