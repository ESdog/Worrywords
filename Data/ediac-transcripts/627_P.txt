[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: Like, you know, on the edge.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_01: Or, like, you know, not like since.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_01: I mean, the biggest thing that changed my behavior was starting to meditate.
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_01: For sure.
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_01: So I did that for the first time about three years ago.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_01: And that pretty much brought me back to myself.
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_01: Kind of like, you know, what I consider to be kind of my true self.
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_01: So that definitely changed my behavior.
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_01: Now I'm acting more from my heart instead of, like, reacting to, like, my thoughts.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_01: About the past or the future.
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_01: Nine times out of ten, I sleep pretty great.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_01: When I don't sleep well, it's pretty clear.

[00:15:04] SPEAKER_01: I kind of keep to myself.
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_01: I don't have that, like, sparkle.
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_01: I don't have that, like, that, like, attack energy.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_01: You know, that energy to go out and get it.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_01: That's kind of how I'm feeling right now.
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_01: A little bit tired.
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_01: Didn't sleep that great last night.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_01: So I went to bed late.
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_01: Normally I go to bed, like, 9, 10 o'clock.
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_01: Last night I went to bed at, like, probably, like, 1 o'clock.
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_01: And I was hoping for a move.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_01: So.
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, today I'm feeling, I'm a little bit, like, blah.
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_01: I'm not really.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_01: Okay.

[00:16:06] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_01: No, I've never been diagnosed. I went through a period where the first two or three years after I was in the army, I kind of wanted life to be the way it was before I had joined the army.
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: The world seemed a lot simpler then to me and a lot more manageable. And then I got hurt while I was playing basketball and I couldn't play hoops for a while for like two years.
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_01: And I'd say like I was pretty down during that period, but I was always, I had one foot in the down.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_01: The down.
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_01: The down zone. But my other foot was in like how do I get myself out of this predicament? Like I never like gave up hope.
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_01: I mean, there's flashes, like thoughts will flash like every one long once in a while where it's like, what's the point? You know, like I'm going to just die at the end anyways. So why fight? You know, why struggle?
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_01: But in general, no, it's 99.999% of the time.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_01: You know, go deep inside and find out what the right thing to do is and then do it the best I can.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_01: Well, I was, I mean, I was pretty happy last night when I saw my old girlfriend and I got to like spend quality time with her and just kind of like give her love and like not make it all about something physical.
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_01: And I was pretty happy when I first got into LA a week ago and I made it to Venice and I was playing hoops and it was pretty good.
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_01: It was sunny. I was beautiful. I was free. I had my car. I had no agenda. I had money in the bank.
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_01: When was the last time I was like ecstatically happy?
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_01: That's tough. Probably, you know, probably when I went on that trip to, well, there was a moment.
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_01: About two years ago, me, my brother and my sister went on a trip together to the Dominican Republic.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_01: That was, um.

Kind of like, you know, what I consider to be kind of my true self. So that definitely changed my behavior. Now I'm acting more from my heart instead of, like, reacting to, like, my thoughts. About the past or the future. Nine times out of ten, I sleep pretty great. When I don't sleep well, it's pretty clear. I'm pretty quiet. I kind of keep to myself. I don't have that, like, sparkle. I don't have that, like, that, like, attack energy. You know, that energy to go out and get it. That's kind of how I'm feeling right now. A little bit tired. Didn't sleep that great last night. So I went to bed late. Normally I go to bed, like, 9, 10 o'clock. Last night I went to bed at, like, probably, like, 1 o'clock. And I was hoping for a move. So. Yeah, today I'm feeling, I'm a little bit, like, blah. Yeah. I'm not really. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. No, I've never been diagnosed. I went through a period where the first two or three years after I was in the army, I kind of wanted life to be the way it was before I had joined the army. The world seemed a lot simpler then to me and a lot more manageable. And then I got hurt while I was playing basketball and I couldn't play hoops for a while for like two years. And I'd say like I was pretty down during that period, but I was always, I had one foot in the down. The down. The down zone. But my other foot was in like how do I get myself out of this predicament? Like I never like gave up hope. I mean, there's flashes, like thoughts will flash like every one long once in a while where it's like, what's the point? You know, like I'm going to just die at the end anyways. So why fight? You know, why struggle? But in general, no, it's 99.999% of the time. You know, go deep inside and find out what the right thing to do is and then do it the best I can. Well, I was, I mean, I was pretty happy last night when I saw my old girlfriend and I got to like spend quality time with her and just kind of like give her love and like not make it all about something physical. And I was pretty happy when I first got into LA a week ago and I made it to Venice and I was playing hoops and it was pretty good. It was sunny. I was beautiful. I was free. I had my car. I had no agenda. I had money in the bank. When was the last time I was like ecstatically happy? That's tough. Probably, you know, probably when I went on that trip to, well, there was a moment. About two years ago, me, my brother and my sister went on a trip together to the Dominican Republic. That was, um. That's great. Who's some of the girls that you've met? Um. Definitely the. Tell me about that. Definitely, yeah, the girl that was. My first love, like she was a great person. She had a really, really good heart. And I kind of. My best friend probably thinks that like, you know, I'm. Um. This like funny, cool guy. That's like going to be a movie star someday or something. And, um. Like take everyone on like trips and like. Just like make everything fun for everyone else. That's great. How about something that is. Yeah, um. I mean you might think that you've ever. Um. twent. My. Were going. I played yesterday against a bunch of guys and it was just great. It was just magical. I love it. I love the people. I love the craziness that comes through there. People on bikes with boom boxes. People in clown suits. People friggin' just doing all kinds of stupid stuff in the background. People on the boardwalk walking by checking it all out. All those people running around making things interesting and playing basketball amidst all of that. It was great. Yeah. You're welcome. Goodbye. Adios.
