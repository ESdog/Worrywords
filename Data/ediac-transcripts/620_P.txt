[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: I read. I'm on the internet.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_01: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:09:11] SPEAKER_01: I would say that I'm okay at controlling my temper.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_01: I don't have fights.
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_01: I've never had any trouble with the law.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_01: So perhaps I'm doing something right.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: Has that gotten you in trouble?
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_01: That was a non sequitur. No.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_01: When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about?
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I had a minor disagreement with my brother last night just about the dynamics of the radio show and the concept of a permanent co-host versus rotating guest hosts.
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_01: And we each look at it differently, and I really didn't fight with him.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_01: I let him have his opinion.
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_01: How do you go about a situation in which you and him are different?
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_01: Nothing really leaps to mind.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_01: I am old enough that I've, by and large, learned how to cope.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: How do you deal with the situation?
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm a little bit of a pain in the ass.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_01: What's something you feel goes without?
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_01: Not being president of the United States.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_01: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_01: Well, the hardest decision I ever made was the easiest decision I've ever made.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_01: Which was leaving the confines of the East Coast, traveling 3,000 miles without family or friends, because it was important to do to fulfill myself.
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_01: Tell me about in your life or something that you wish to erase from your memory.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: Hmm.
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_01: You know, it's hard to respond to that, because even negative images and experiences I learn from.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_01: You know, I'm going to be philosophical and say I'm happy for all my experiences and I'm happy for all my scars.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_01: Any other suggestions?
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: How old were you when you joined the military?

[00:12:17] SPEAKER_01: How did you decide to move to the military?
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_01: It was not much of a decision. It was essentially forced on me and others. We had a draft at that time.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_01: Are you happy with your decision?
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_01: I am now.
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_01: Did you ever see combat?

[00:13:09] SPEAKER_01: How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life?
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_01: No, no. I went back to civilian life. I worked a job and went to school and functioned.
[00:13:27] SPEAKER_01: Okay. What did you do after the military?
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_01: I was a soldier.
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_01: I came home to Pennsylvania, finished my college and then moved to California.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_01: I didn't quite hear that one. How did the military treat me? Fairly.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_01: And I got the benefit of the GI Bill for my education.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_01: And I currently have the medical benefit of the VA. So I suppose the deal worked out favorably for each of us.

[00:14:19] SPEAKER_01: Pretty good. Optimistic. Fit.

[00:14:58] SPEAKER_01: I sleep just fine. No problem.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_01: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_01: When? No, I typically do sleep well. If I don't get enough sleep, it impacts my day, of course.

[00:16:36] SPEAKER_01: I think people find me pretty upbeat, cheerful, enthusiastic.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_01: They certainly would say smart.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_01: That's great.
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_01: Tell me about something you know you can make the community enjoy.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_01: Yesterday, I had a wonderful 10-mile bike ride in the heat.

But if she stops for any amount of time, ring the doorbell. Yeah. I get you. I get you. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? It's a good day. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm a native of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. Okay. Okay. Where are some things you do? What do you like about LA? The lack of snow. The weather's good. And it's a more open, free, liberal place. Uh-huh. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I am extremely happy to be in LA. I'm extremely happy to be not on a plane. I'm very happy to be on the East Coast. Um, so, I'm gonna say that I have no complaints. I'm pretty much live in a village, and my village is a couple square miles, and I meet all my needs close by. What do you enjoy about LA? I enjoy traveling. I travel by bicycle, and I enjoy the fitness that I derive. I'd like to hear about one of your trips. I have the same trip every day. I jump on the bike by Sunset Strip. Roll two miles downhill to the farmer's market for lunch. Go three more miles uphill to the post office and shopping, and roll down Sunset back home again. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Da-da-da-da-da-da. Well, they're all pretty good. Um. I used to attend the Little League World Series, and that was a memorable experience. What did you study at school? English Lit. What do you do now? I am involved in politics and writing. I've just launched an internet radio show. What's your dream job? It might be reasonable to say that I have that dream job right now, in terms of I'm fully immersed in the media, and I have an outlet. What's your favorite TV show? The New York Times. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm a pretty perfect combination of both, but I'm outgoing as a public persona. Why? Well, it's necessary to be outgoing to communicate, to persuade, to function in society, and to educate. And to entertain, and to have lively friendships. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm the oldest of nine. We're in pretty good shape. I talk to my brother John each week, my sister Mary each week, my sister Patty each week, my sister Dolores every couple weeks. So we're in pretty good shape. Sometimes when I'm feeling down, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do your last week? I watch MSNBC. I watch many of the political shows. I read. I'm on the internet. How are you at controlling your temper? I would say that I'm okay at controlling my temper. I don't have fights. I've never had any trouble with the law. So perhaps I'm doing something right. Has that gotten you in trouble? That was a non sequitur. No. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Oh, I had a minor disagreement with my brother last night just about the dynamics of the radio show and the concept of a permanent co-host versus rotating guest hosts. And we each look at it differently, and I really didn't fight with him. I let him have his opinion. How do you go about a situation in which you and him are different? Nothing really leaps to mind. I am old enough that I've, by and large, learned how to cope. How do you deal with the situation? I'm a little bit of a pain in the ass. What's something you feel goes without? Not being president of the United States. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, the hardest decision I ever made was the easiest decision I've ever made. Which was leaving the confines of the East Coast, traveling 3,000 miles without family or friends, because it was important to do to fulfill myself. Tell me about in your life or something that you wish to erase from your memory. Hmm. You know, it's hard to respond to that, because even negative images and experiences I learn from. You know, I'm going to be philosophical and say I'm happy for all my experiences and I'm happy for all my scars. Any other suggestions? Yes. How old were you when you joined the military? I was 21 when I joined the military. How did you decide to move to the military? It was not much of a decision. It was essentially forced on me and others. We had a draft at that time. Are you happy with your decision? I am now. Did you ever see combat? Did I see combat? We were rocketed and I was near a medevac hospital. I've seen combat images. I've seen mangled people coming in off the helicopters. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? No, no. I went back to civilian life. I worked a job and went to school and functioned. Okay. What did you do after the military? I was a soldier. I came home to Pennsylvania, finished my college and then moved to California. I didn't quite hear that one. How did the military treat me? Fairly. And I got the benefit of the GI Bill for my education. And I currently have the medical benefit of the VA. So I suppose the deal worked out favorably for each of us. All right. How do you feel about the new school? Pretty good. Optimistic. Fit. Okay. How do you understand the changes in the behavior of the up-clarge? I'm getting more done. You know, I'm being more productive and more fulfilled lately. How easy was it for you to get a good night's sleep? I sleep. No problemo. I'm sorry to hear that. Why? I sleep just fine. No problem. What are you like when you don't sleep well? When? No, I typically do sleep well. If I don't get enough sleep, it impacts my day, of course. Have you ever been diagnosed with sleep apnea? No, I have not. I have not. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? I have not been diagnosed with depression. When was the last time you felt really happy? I felt really happy on Sunday, having achieved a radio program. And I'm glad I did. I got on the Internet and shared it with my friends. That's great. Who's some of the top positive influence in your life? Let us say people who impacted my youth. Gave me my first job in radio, and that was a wonderful thing. Thank you. Thank you. How are your best friends? You might have to ask him. I think people find me pretty upbeat, cheerful, enthusiastic. They certainly would say smart. That's great. Tell me about something you know you can make the community enjoy. Yesterday, I had a wonderful 10-mile bike ride in the heat. And I'm happy that I'm physically able to do that. Nice. What are you most proud of in the world? I hope I've made the most progress in some ways. I'm most proud that I've survived all manner of dangers, and I have endured, I have persevered. I'll even be bold enough to say that I have triumphed. It's been a joy. Goodbye.
