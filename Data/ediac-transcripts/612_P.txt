==================================================

[00:00:00] SPEAKER_03: But as she gets started up, I'll tell you what we're doing.
[00:00:01] SPEAKER_03: So research has shown that talking about your problems out loud can have long-term benefits.
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_03: So we're trying to explore how we can use technology to improve that process.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_03: So our virtual human uses artificial intelligence to have a conversation with you
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_03: while still preserving your anonymity.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_03: So I'll explain to you a little bit more about what I mean here.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_03: So this is Ellie.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_03: She's going to ask you some questions, and then you're just going to answer normally
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_03: by talking into the microphone.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_03: She's going to use speech recognition technology to understand what you say,
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_03: and then she's going to use a very complex series of equations to figure out
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_03: the way to respond to you and keep the conversation going.
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_03: Oh, there she goes.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_03: All right.
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_03: She also uses software that incorporates the Xbox Kinect and the webcam
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_03: to recognize your facial expressions and posture,
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_03: so she can try to take your feelings into account as the interview progresses as well.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_03: So I'm going to wait for a couple other things to start up here.
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_03: And the way that it will work is when I leave the room,
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_03: she's going to start.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_03: She's going to start asking you questions, and then when she's done,
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_03: she's going to say goodbye, and you're going to press this button
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_03: to let me know you guys are done.
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_03: So I know it's natural.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_03: You're going to maybe want to ask her some questions,
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_03: but the technology is not quite there yet.
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_03: So she'll ask you some things, but unfortunately,
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_03: she probably can't answer too many questions about herself,
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_03: so you can let her do the asking.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_03: And just based on prior experience,
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_03: if there's a period of time where she takes more than about 10 seconds,
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_03: to answer you, and she's not moving on, go ahead and press this button.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_03: Oh, it froze or something?
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_03: Hopefully that doesn't happen, but it's happened recently,
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_03: and I don't want to have that happen to you.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_03: So I don't want you to be sitting in here wondering what's happening.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_03: Okay.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_03: Hi.

[00:02:05] SPEAKER_04: and would love to learn about you.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_04: I'll ask you a few questions before I get started.

[00:03:02] SPEAKER_00: I admit, it's a love story.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_00: What are some done to make people
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: Oh, the traffic's pretty bad.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: Crime.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: Oh, the traffic's pretty bad.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: Crime.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: I'm alright?
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: I'm good.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: Have you traveled a lot?
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: Some.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: Not too much.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: Some?
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: What do you enjoy about traveling?
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_00: You can see new things, experience new things.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: I'd like to hear about one of your trips.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: Well, we work with pet rescues, so I've done some local travel just to work events to help save pets.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: And that's what I like to do.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: What's one of your most memorable experiences?
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_00: In travel?
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_00: Whatever comes to mind.
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_00: I was in the military for a long time.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_00: That's usually a big chunk of my memories.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_00: I was in the military over 15 years.
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: So...
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: What did you study at school?
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_00: Social work.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: What do you do now?
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: Now I have a small business.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_00: All right.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_00: What's your dream job?
[00:04:34] SPEAKER_00: I think a job where I can make a difference, maybe helping pet rescues.
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_00: Maybe also helping veterans that are in need.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: Outgoing.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: I just do a lot of things.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: I easily adapt to new people, new situations, new surroundings.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm always on the go.
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about your relationship with your family.
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_00: My relationship is pretty good.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_00: A lot of my family is spread out, so a lot of communication is done by the phone or internet
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_00: now, whereas we used to be a lot closer in location than we are now.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fish Tank screensaver.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: Hey, I know it's not a lot of fun.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_00: I'm from Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: What do you do to relax?
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: Actually, I like to be physically active.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_00: It relaxes me.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: I like to go for walks.
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_00: I'm overweight and working on the problems from that, so I like to do that because it feels like it's a positive thing.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: Very good.
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_00: Very good at that.
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: Tell me more about that.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_00: I can't even think of anything.
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_00: It's been so long.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_00: It's been a long time.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: There's been times where things like I maybe didn't work as hard at something as I should have, perhaps.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_00: What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: I didn't finish my college education, and I kind of feel bad.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: Like I let people down.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_00: I really don't know.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_00: Most things have come pretty easy for me.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_00: I don't really – I haven't really – I've been fortunate not to really be placed in a situation where I had to make a really difficult decision.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_00: My parents were divorced when I was young.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_00: Maybe that would be it.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever served in the military?

[00:08:11] SPEAKER_00: Why did you decide to join the military?

[00:08:22] SPEAKER_00: Are you happy you did that?
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: Did you ever see combat?
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: All right.
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_00: How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life?
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: Pretty easy.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't – I actually didn't go back into civilian life.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_00: I went into the Reserves.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_00: I was Reserves, then I went back into the Reserve.
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_00: So I never really cut the ties with the military at that time.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_00: What did you do after the military?
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: Went back to work. Spent time with my family.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_00: How did serving in the military change you?
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_00: I think it made me more patriotic, more honorable.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_00: All right.
[00:09:30] SPEAKER_00: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: Pretty good.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_00: Tell me more about that.
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_00: Emotionally great. My health isn't as good as it should be,
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: so I'm working on that. That's one of my main focus.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_00: Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: Not really.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_00: Usually it's pretty easy. I go to bed pretty tired.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_00: Sleepy. Worn down.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?

[00:10:40] SPEAKER_00: What were your symptoms?
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_00: I don't think I really have any symptoms of PTSD.

[00:11:07] SPEAKER_00: I know people that have PTSD or those who claim to have PTSD.
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_00: I don't really match that.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_00: How do you cope with them?
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_00: If I had symptoms, I would try to get help through the VA, I guess.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_00: But I don't have symptoms.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_00: That I don't have symptoms? Sure. I don't have symptoms.
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_00: What got you to seek help?

[00:12:00] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_00: Do you feel therapy is useful?
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: I guess so.
