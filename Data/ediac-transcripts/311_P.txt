[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: Well, I didn't argue with a real person.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: Can you say a little more about that?
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_00: Yes. I have a person that I hear once in a while, and I talked to them, and I had an argument about them listening on my phone.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed?
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_00: Avoidance. Whatever annoys me.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_00: Okay. What's one of your most memorable feelings?
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: Being homeless.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_00: Wow. That sounds really hard.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: Yes, it was.
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_00: What was your rule in that moment?
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_00: Well, they don't particularly like homeless people in L.A.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_00: So it's really hard if you're homeless.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: Where do you live?
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: Oh, right now I live in an apartment.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: How do you like your living situation?
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: I don't. I don't like the neighbors.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry to hear that. What's it like for you living in an apartment?
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_00: Well, they harass you all the time. So I don't come out of the apartment.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_00: That's tough.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_00: Have you done anything to avoid it?
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_00: Well, I didn't know when I moved there that they were horrible people.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: And I've complained to management, but they don't do anything about it. They just tell me to move.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: I'm kidding.
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: Yes. Back in the 90s.
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_00: What got you into this health?
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: Crying all the time.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_00: That sounds really hard.
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_00: Did you go to the therapist for helping you?
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_00: Yes. Yes. I was in the hospital two months ago for 15 days.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: Tell me more about that.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: I was in there for depression, for arguing with a person. That's not real.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: Really?
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_00: What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy?
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: I ignore the person when I hear them.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_00: How hard is that?
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: It's not hard anymore. It was before I was going to therapy.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: That's so good to hear. How has being in therapy affected you?
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: It's helped me be more cheerful and ignore things that bother me.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_00: What were your symptoms?
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_00: Sleeping all the time, eating too much, arguing, screaming at this unreal person.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: Did you think you had a problem before you found out?
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: Before I found out?
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_00: Lately, I've still been pretty depressed.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you feel that way often?
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_00: Very hard.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: Are you triggered by something?
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_00: Well, I wake up about every two hours to go to the bathroom, or some noise wakes me up.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_00: So I don't sleep well. I'm tired all the time.
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_00: How do you feel about your sleep?
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure.
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you felt really happy?
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: Don't remember.
