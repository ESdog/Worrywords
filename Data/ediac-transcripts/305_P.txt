[00:01:34] SPEAKER_00: What is it like for you living with them?
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_00: Well, I have one as a girlfriend, so I consider her a roommate, lover type thing.

[00:01:50] SPEAKER_00: Um, we're pretty close.
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_00: How do you know them?
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_00: I met her last year, and we've been through some troubling times, but we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_00: That's good. Tell me more about that.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: The troubling times?

[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: I would, let me see.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: Well, I had gotten a DUI last year and lost my job. I'm a truck driver by trade, so that kind of threw me way off.
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: Having a $1400 a week job and then going to nothing, kind of like, plus losing my license, kind of like, really threw me off.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_00: And I couldn't, I haven't really found anything that I was interested in.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_00: So I started cooking, and, or trying to see which other route I can go as far as having some kind of a career.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: And so, I'm choosing to go into the culinary field, but, you know, meanwhile I still have to work.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: It's hard to find work without a job.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to school.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: And, uh, so, but I think today I applied at Rouse, so hopefully I'll get that, I should have that job actually.
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_00: So, um, but I'm starting to see a light, like I said, at the end of that tunnel now.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_00: A little by little.

[00:08:54] SPEAKER_00: And what it was about was just her lying to me, telling me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something in that aspect.

[00:12:49] SPEAKER_00: I have three brothers, one sister.
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: And I'm probably not really close to my family.
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_00: I'm really close to none of my siblings.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: I speak with one brother quite a bit.
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: My other youngest brother, you know, I'd just rather not, you know, I converse with him, but it's, you know, I try to keep it on a professional basis.
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_00: My sister I don't talk to at all.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_00: My other brother underneath me, I haven't spoken to him in years.
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_00: So I'm just close with my mom, my niece, some of my nephews, and that's about it.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_00: Okay.

[00:13:51] SPEAKER_00: I don't call them.
[00:13:51] SPEAKER_00: I don't ask about them.
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: I, you know, I talk to my mom about it.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: I talk to my mom quite a bit.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: I talk to my brother quite a bit.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: But I just don't bring up those subjects.
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_00: Or if they are brought up, I just usually say, you know, that's on them.
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_00: And I really don't want nothing to do with them, so.
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_00: I think it would be, how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_00: Um, it's been hard lately.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_00: It's been probably hard for the last going on a year.
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_00: You know, I, um, depends on my thought process at the time.
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_00: Like I said, I've been looking for work quite a bit.
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_00: Um, so just wondering why, you know, I don't get called.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_00: I just have my, I have racing thoughts.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_00: So, or I get depressed, you know, or I worry about things that, you know, that really I have no control over.
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_00: So.
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_00: You know.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_00: Lately I've just been sleeping a little bit too much.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_00: At least for me, because I'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a night.
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: And now it's changed to about eight to nine hours.
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_00: And I'm still tired.
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: Do you feel that way often?
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_00: Uh, lately I haven't.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_00: Probably about the last few months.
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:15:17] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_00: Tired.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_00: Ha ha.
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_00: I, you know, if I don't sleep well, it seems that I just dwell back on the same things
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_00: that have been bothering me.
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, I'm more of a guy, you know, I love to work.
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_00: And if I'm not, then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head.
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_00: And so, you know, um, like there, I, if I'm busy, if I'm doing what I, you know, I'm,
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_00: you know, in whatever job I do, I kind of, you know, get into it.
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_00: I enjoy it.
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_00: Uh, it's something new for me.
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_00: And, uh, so I can think about, you know, either work or I can go home and then think about
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_00: this, you know, I don't have to worry about, you know, um, money, uh, you know, bills getting
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_00: paid.
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_00: And I can just concentrate on other things, either, you know, doing the things I like
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_00: or, you know, maybe spending time with my family.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_00: Maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or, you know, so stuff like
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_00: that.
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_00: How do you cope with them?
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_00: How I what?
[00:16:29] SPEAKER_00: How do you cope with them?
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_00: How do I cope with them?
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: Uh, I just try not to think about it.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_00: Uh, as in, it's not about whether coping with it or not.
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_00: Um, I just do.
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: It's, uh, um, I just do.
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_00: I'm a workaholic guy.
[00:16:51] SPEAKER_00: I just, you know, it may take me a moment to, to, uh, say that I'm coping with something.
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_00: But, you know, if I have no control over it, there's nothing that I can really do about
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: it.
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: The only thing I can do is continue to do what I'm doing.
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_00: And that's actively looking for work, uh, actively going out on, uh, interviews, uh,
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_00: talking with others about work so that I can just kind of, you know, give back to them.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to go back to, uh, back to basics, you know.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_00: I just don't let a lot of stuff bother me.
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_00: It does bother me, but I try not to, to let it continue to bother me.
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_00: Has that gotten you in trouble?
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_00: Has that gotten you in trouble?
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_00: If what has gotten me in trouble?
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_00: My moods?
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_00: I mean.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, money, I mean, you know, my past, I got a past history, so, which kind of tends to bother my hiring process.
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if I'm going to get hired, so I got to deal with different type of employers who are, say, felony friendly and stuff like that.
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_00: And I try, you know, I'm taking classes on how to interview, how to answer some of the questions, which, you know, come up quite a bit.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_00: And I kind of reflect back on that, but I just, I got to keep putting into my head that that's not who I want to be anymore.
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_00: So, or, you know, I've done, I've done.
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_00: I've done my time, so to say, but I took the time, you know, the last time, I just took a lot of time and tried to work on the issues that were bothering me.
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, towards positive stuff, I got my GEDs and different things, took a lot of classes.
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_00: Thought about going to school, looking to go into school.
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_00: And, yeah.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: Anything that would kind of change my old ways and try to move on to more productive activities.
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_00: That's good. Do you feel like therapy's useful?
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_00: Pardon?
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_00: Do you feel like therapy's useful?
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_00: I still didn't hear you.
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_00: Do you feel like therapy's useful?
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_00: That people have been deceitful?
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_00: Can you repeat that one more time?
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_00: I'll talk about that later.
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_00: Alright.
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_00: Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_00: I've been diagnosed with bipolarism.
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_00: How hard is that?
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_00: It's tough if you don't, you know, I don't medicate.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_00: So, I mean, I have been on medications before in the past, but I guess I try to live life on life's terms.
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_00: And I just, you know, I know the medical establishment always want to label something.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: And what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills.
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_00: You know, I've been on probably every manageable pill that there is for that.
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, some of them have been too strong or some of them are not strong enough.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_00: And so I just try to cope with things with just my life skills, you know.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to be using drugs.
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_00: I know certain drugs work for like three to four months, six months.
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_00: And then they go, well, here, I'm going to try you on this.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: Or I'm going to try you on that.
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_00: And it's just an ongoing process.
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_00: And I probably for about the last two years, actually about three years, I kind of just said, you know what, that's it.
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_00: And whether it's different than whether if I would be on meds for it, I don't think so.
[00:21:32] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's just still the same stuff.
[00:21:33] SPEAKER_00: I still get the same problems.
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_00: And I still get the same anxieties as if I was on medications.
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_00: I still get the same communication for it or not.
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_00: So I just, you know, deal with it, you know.
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes it's not good.
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_00: You know, I get irritated at people a lot.
[00:21:49] SPEAKER_00: I don't like people.
[00:21:51] SPEAKER_00: I don't like crowds.
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_00: I don't like obnoxious people.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_00: I usually am pretty quiet.
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_00: But I got a, you know, it's not that I have personality, but I think people can see me and just say, ah, don't mess with this guy.
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_00: But still, you know, I ride public transportation quite a bit.
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, you just get a lot of loud, obnoxious people on there.
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I got to get off the bus.
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_00: That's how I deal with people.
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_00: Because I just know there's consequences if I didn't deal with it that way.
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_00: So I just let it go.
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_00: I'd rather take the time on getting off the bus, waiting for the next bus, and hopefully it's not that bad.
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_00: I understand.
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_00: Did you think you had a problem before you found out?
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_00: Did I have a problem before I got out?
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_00: Did you think you had a problem before you found out?
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_00: The thing is that I know other people.
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_00: I have a lot of ups and downs.
[00:23:05] SPEAKER_00: So I know a lot of, in my younger days, people would tell me, you know,
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_00: when I told them that I was diagnosed with bipolar, that a lot of remarks were like,
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_00: oh, that's what was wrong with me.
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_00: We wish that you would have found that out years ago.
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_00: And like I said, I don't think the meds really work.
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_00: But what I do, I think time kind of, just getting older kind of makes it work.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_00: Me dealing with life.
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_00: How has seeing a therapist affected you?
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_00: Pardon me?
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_00: How has seeing a therapist affected you?
[00:23:49] SPEAKER_00: I talk to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while recently.
[00:23:57] SPEAKER_00: And it helps a lot, you know, just to get out my anger, my thoughts.
[00:24:05] SPEAKER_00: A lot of people, other people may not understand that.
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_00: But a therapist is, I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out,
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_00: whatever is bothering me, whether it be people, you know, other issues, you know,
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_00: whatever the case may be, I just think talking about it.
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_00: And there's such good listeners.
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_00: And kind of like, you know, they give me the same advice that, you know, that I, you know,
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_00: give myself or whatever that I would give to others.
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_00: But it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else, somebody who supposedly has a,
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_00: you know, or, you know, they go to school for this.
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_00: But it's good to hear.
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_00: That's so good to hear.
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_00: What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy?
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't go anymore.
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_00: So I kind of miss it.
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: You know, like I said, I miss it a lot actually.
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_00: But it's just one of those things, you know, I just deal with it, you know, accordingly.
[00:25:18] SPEAKER_00: You know, if I ever get a chance to go through therapy again, I probably will.
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_00: Why did you stop?
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_00: Well, monetary reasons.
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, I don't have health insurance.
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_00: There's a lot of things that, you know, I'd like to do but I can't, you know.
[00:25:38] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:25:38] SPEAKER_00: You know, money situation is not that great right now, so.
[00:25:42] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_00: How would your best friend describe you?
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_00: How would my friends describe me?
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_00: They would probably describe me as an energetic, outgoing person.
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_00: Once I get to know people.
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_00: Laugh.
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_00: I laugh a lot.
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_00: But they would probably tell you that I'm also very serious.
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_00: And a hidden person.
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_00: I don't reveal a lot, you know.
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_00: And so.
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_00: Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_00: Someone who has been a positive influence in my life?
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_00: Someone who's been, um.
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_00: Someone who's been a positive influence in my life.
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_00: Probably my boss.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_00: One of my bosses.
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_00: When I first started with, uh.
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_00: With exotic animals.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_00: He was real, you know, he was, uh.
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_00: German.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_00: And, um.
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_00: They didn't teach.
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: I don't know what he saw in me.
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_00: But.
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_00: He taught me a lot about.
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_00: Working with exotic animals.
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_00: And, uh.
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_00: He showed a lot of confidence in me.
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_00: And which.
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_00: And.
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_00: Also built confidence in myself.
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:27:37] SPEAKER_00: And, uh.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_00: Sort of let me know that, you know.
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_00: There's nothing that I really can't accomplish if I put my mind to it.
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_00: So.
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_00: You know.
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_00: That sounds like a great situation.
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_00: It was.
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_00: I think I've asked everything I need to.
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_00: Okay.

==================================================
FULL TRANSCRIPTION:

 Okay, looks good. So if we can just move around a little bit to activate the connect until we see a green skeleton looking thing up there. Just move around. There it goes. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and start up the virtual human that you'll be talking to. When it's over, will you just go ahead and ring this bell so I know that it's done? Okay. Will it let me know that I'm done? Yes. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started, and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How do you do that? How are you doing today? I'm doing alright. That's good. Where are you from originally? Originally I'm from California. Born in Glendale. Nice. How do you like your living situation? I'm not too happy with it. Why? I'm just unemployed at the moment, but actually seeking, doing what I'm supposed to be doing. There's some prospects there, but hopefully I'll learn something today. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Do you have roommates? Yeah. What is it like for you living with them? Well, I have one as a girlfriend, so I consider her a roommate, lover type thing. Oh. How close are you to them? Pardon me? How close are you to them? Um, we're pretty close. How do you know them? I met her last year, and we've been through some troubling times, but we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. That's good. Tell me more about that. The troubling times? Yes. Uh. I would, let me see. Well, I had gotten a DUI last year and lost my job. I'm a truck driver by trade, so that kind of threw me way off. Having a $1400 a week job and then going to nothing, kind of like, plus losing my license, kind of like, really threw me off. And I couldn't, I haven't really found anything that I was interested in. So I started cooking, and, or trying to see which other route I can go as far as having some kind of a career. And so, I'm choosing to go into the culinary field, but, you know, meanwhile I still have to work. It's hard to find work without a job. I'm not going to school. And, uh, so, but I think today I applied at Rouse, so hopefully I'll get that, I should have that job actually. So, um, but I'm starting to see a light, like I said, at the end of that tunnel now. A little by little. That's good. What's your dream job? My dream job would be probably forestry service. Oh, okay. Out in the wilderness. Really? How did you decide to do that? Pardon me? How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, I have a lot of love for animals. I'm an exotic animal trainer by trade, and, uh, so, and I like being, I don't like people too much. So being outdoors, and I've always enjoyed being outdoors. That's how I like being a truck driver. I've traveled the world. I don't necessarily like being in a warehouse. I don't like being in a warehouse. Or in an office. I'm more of a outdoors type of guy. Yeah. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Uh, one of my trips would be, uh, I spent a year and a half in Japan. And on the lower island there that they built that bridge, the largest bridge in the world. And, uh, I went there to work for, uh, for an all-white, an all-white tiger act. And, uh, working for Japanese circuits. So it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of Americans. But that was one of the islands also that we, uh, that they bombed. So there was a lot of negativity, but I pretty have a good out, you know, outlook on life. Uh, especially during those times. You know, I, I enjoyed myself, you know, all the traveling and meeting new people. And, um, eating, you know, different, uh, diverse foods. And, uh, it was a good experience for me. All that whole experience was pretty good for me. You know, just traveling around with circuses and, uh, you know, it's been great. Nice. What are some things you really like about LA? Uh. I, uh, uh, probably, um, some of the things I like about LA. There's not a lot that I like about LA, but, uh, I like Hollywood. I like the, uh, the movie industry. Um, the, uh, huge, uh, uh, different, different, you know, different, uh, different, uh, uh, different different ethnics of people here you know I enjoyed talking to you know a lot of foreigners you know I'd like to see where you came from and what what it's like there yeah traffic's ferocious yeah what are some things that make you really mad traffic ignorance being disrespectful being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful towards you or other people that's about it okay when was the last time it happened I don't know I don't know when was the last time it happened I don't know when was the last time it happened it happened on a daily basis it seems like you know I ride the bus a lot so you know or if I'm riding my bike people tend to almost run me over so I'm not totally paying attention to traffic you know I find myself sometimes you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of I having to ride away or stuff like that yeah big time what do you do when you're annoyed what do I do when I'm annoyed probably sit there and vent you know speak my mind even though a lot of times it's by myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you know wishing that I carried rocks in my back pocket so I can ride my bike you know I'm not gonna ride my bike all the a wave they set off on me because I'm gonna the actions I've been making everyone wanted to see but it happened so much the video millions of visual things was going on and it was I needed to waste and occupied myself in a way that they would put me Het님� stretching me and the bhj when for veya even if I lose trim tires it was my parents being Phillip right I didn't want to get out of the pit�eep with you mentioned the the pitPaul argue with someone and what was it about? It was with my girlfriend and it was about being honest. I'm pretty honest with, I'm open and honest about anything and everything. And what it was about was just her lying to me, telling me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something in that aspect. And I come to find out a week later that it was a total lie. So I just didn't like that at all. Yeah. How did you feel in that moment? Pardon? How did you feel in that moment? Um, let me see the word for it. Just that I don't know now whether I can be honest. I can't believe anything she said. So it was, I felt hurt, you know, that, you know, here we've been in a relationship for a little bit and that's probably one of my biggest pet peeves is being honest. I don't, like I said, I don't hold back. I'm pretty honest with anything and everything that I do or say. So, you know, and if you're lying about something, well, you just, you're always, you're always lying. And I just, I don't see any, you know, so it kind of took a lot from me trusting her now, you know, or whatever. Now I'm like, you know, is it truthful? Is it not? No, so it's kind of hurt our relationship. I'm sorry to hear that. It doesn't bother me. What are some things you like to do for your clients? What do you like to do for fun? Fun? I like going to the beach. I love shooting darts, but I haven't done it in a while. I love to paint. I got into watercolor painting and I'm pretty gifted at that. And I want to try some other mediums and let me see. I love fishing. Haven't gone in a while though. And I like driving trucks. You know, it's, you know, my job, you know, I really, really enjoy that. I don't like driving through cities, but usually when I'm in the middle of the night where I can see all the stars, I like stargazing. See if I can pick out some of those astronomy stars up there. And I'm a pretty easy going guy, so shooting pool, sunshine, just things I like. That's great. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Most memorable experiences? Good or bad? What ever comes to your mind? Most memorable experiences? Probably playing with lions and tigers, wrestling a baby elephant in a mud puddle. Oh my gosh. Just enjoying myself. Awesome. Yeah. How close are you to your family? Not. I don't have much family as it is. At least here in the States I don't. My mom's from Central America, so. But I'm not close to. I have three brothers, one sister. And I'm probably not really close to my family. I'm really close to none of my siblings. I speak with one brother quite a bit. My other youngest brother, you know, I'd just rather not, you know, I converse with him, but it's, you know, I try to keep it on a professional basis. My sister I don't talk to at all. My other brother underneath me, I haven't spoken to him in years. So I'm just close with my mom, my niece, some of my nephews, and that's about it. Okay. Have you done anything to avoid it? Have I done anything to avoid it? Yes. Um, to avoid them? Yes. Yeah, I just don't talk to them. I don't call them. I don't ask about them. I, you know, I talk to my mom about it. I talk to my mom quite a bit. I talk to my brother quite a bit. But I just don't bring up those subjects. Or if they are brought up, I just usually say, you know, that's on them. And I really don't want nothing to do with them, so. I think it would be, how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Um, it's been hard lately. It's been probably hard for the last going on a year. Um. You know, I, um, depends on my thought process at the time. Like I said, I've been looking for work quite a bit. Um, so just wondering why, you know, I don't get called. I just have my, I have racing thoughts. So, or I get depressed, you know, or I worry about things that, you know, that really I have no control over. So. Yeah. You know. Lately I've just been sleeping a little bit too much. Um. At least for me, because I'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a night. And now it's changed to about eight to nine hours. And I'm still tired. Mm-hmm. Do you feel that way often? Uh, lately I haven't. Probably about the last few months. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um. Tired. Ha ha. Um. I, you know, if I don't sleep well, it seems that I just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me. So, you know, I'm more of a guy, you know, I love to work. Um. And if I'm not, then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head. Mm-hmm. And so, you know, um, like there, I, if I'm busy, if I'm doing what I, you know, I'm, you know, in whatever job I do, I kind of, you know, get into it. I enjoy it. Uh, it's something new for me. And, uh, so I can think about, you know, either work or I can go home and then think about this, you know, I don't have to worry about, you know, um, money, uh, you know, bills getting paid. And I can just concentrate on other things, either, you know, doing the things I like or, you know, maybe spending time with my family. Maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or, you know, so stuff like that. How do you cope with them? How I what? How do you cope with them? How do I cope with them? Uh, I just try not to think about it. Uh, as in, it's not about whether coping with it or not. Um, I just do. It's, uh, um, I just do. I'm a workaholic guy. I just, you know, it may take me a moment to, to, uh, say that I'm coping with something. But, you know, if I have no control over it, there's nothing that I can really do about it. The only thing I can do is continue to do what I'm doing. And that's actively looking for work, uh, actively going out on, uh, interviews, uh, talking with others about work so that I can just kind of, you know, give back to them. I don't want to go back to, uh, back to basics, you know. I just don't let a lot of stuff bother me. It does bother me, but I try not to, to let it continue to bother me. Yeah. Has that gotten you in trouble? Has that gotten you in trouble? If what has gotten me in trouble? My moods? I mean. Yeah. Yeah, money, I mean, you know, my past, I got a past history, so, which kind of tends to bother my hiring process. I don't know if I'm going to get hired, so I got to deal with different type of employers who are, say, felony friendly and stuff like that. And I try, you know, I'm taking classes on how to interview, how to answer some of the questions, which, you know, come up quite a bit. And I kind of reflect back on that, but I just, I got to keep putting into my head that that's not who I want to be anymore. So, or, you know, I've done, I've done. I've done my time, so to say, but I took the time, you know, the last time, I just took a lot of time and tried to work on the issues that were bothering me. So, you know, towards positive stuff, I got my GEDs and different things, took a lot of classes. Thought about going to school, looking to go into school. And, yeah. Anything that would kind of change my old ways and try to move on to more productive activities. That's good. Do you feel like therapy's useful? Pardon? Do you feel like therapy's useful? I still didn't hear you. Do you feel like therapy's useful? That people have been deceitful? Can you repeat that one more time? I'll talk about that later. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I've been diagnosed with bipolarism. Okay. How hard is that? It's tough if you don't, you know, I don't medicate. So, I mean, I have been on medications before in the past, but I guess I try to live life on life's terms. And I just, you know, I know the medical establishment always want to label something. And what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills. You know, I've been on probably every manageable pill that there is for that. And, you know, some of them have been too strong or some of them are not strong enough. And so I just try to cope with things with just my life skills, you know. I don't want to be using drugs. I know certain drugs work for like three to four months, six months. And then they go, well, here, I'm going to try you on this. Or I'm going to try you on that. And it's just an ongoing process. And I probably for about the last two years, actually about three years, I kind of just said, you know what, that's it. And whether it's different than whether if I would be on meds for it, I don't think so. You know, it's just still the same stuff. I still get the same problems. And I still get the same anxieties as if I was on medications. I still get the same communication for it or not. So I just, you know, deal with it, you know. Sometimes it's not good. You know, I get irritated at people a lot. I don't like people. I don't like crowds. I don't like obnoxious people. I usually am pretty quiet. But I got a, you know, it's not that I have personality, but I think people can see me and just say, ah, don't mess with this guy. But still, you know, I ride public transportation quite a bit. And, you know, you just get a lot of loud, obnoxious people on there. Sometimes I got to get off the bus. That's how I deal with people. Because I just know there's consequences if I didn't deal with it that way. So I just let it go. I'd rather take the time on getting off the bus, waiting for the next bus, and hopefully it's not that bad. I understand. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Did I have a problem before I got out? Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Well, I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out. The thing is that I know other people. I have a lot of ups and downs. So I know a lot of, in my younger days, people would tell me, you know, when I told them that I was diagnosed with bipolar, that a lot of remarks were like, oh, that's what was wrong with me. We wish that you would have found that out years ago. And like I said, I don't think the meds really work. But what I do, I think time kind of, just getting older kind of makes it work. Yeah. Me dealing with life. How has seeing a therapist affected you? Pardon me? How has seeing a therapist affected you? I talk to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while recently. And it helps a lot, you know, just to get out my anger, my thoughts. A lot of people, other people may not understand that. But a therapist is, I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out, whatever is bothering me, whether it be people, you know, other issues, you know, whatever the case may be, I just think talking about it. And there's such good listeners. And kind of like, you know, they give me the same advice that, you know, that I, you know, give myself or whatever that I would give to others. But it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else, somebody who supposedly has a, you know, or, you know, they go to school for this. Right. But it's good to hear. That's so good to hear. Yeah. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Well, I don't go anymore. So I kind of miss it. You know, like I said, I miss it a lot actually. But it's just one of those things, you know, I just deal with it, you know, accordingly. You know, if I ever get a chance to go through therapy again, I probably will. Why did you stop? Well, monetary reasons. And, you know, I don't have health insurance. There's a lot of things that, you know, I'd like to do but I can't, you know. Yeah. You know, money situation is not that great right now, so. I'm sorry. How would your best friend describe you? How would my friends describe me? Yeah. Um. They would probably describe me as an energetic, outgoing person. Once I get to know people. Laugh. I laugh a lot. But they would probably tell you that I'm also very serious. And a hidden person. I don't reveal a lot, you know. And so. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Someone who has been a positive influence in my life? Yeah. Someone who's been, um. Yeah. Yeah. Someone who's been a positive influence in my life. Probably my boss. One of my bosses. When I first started with, uh. With exotic animals. He was real, you know, he was, uh. German. And, um. They didn't teach. I don't know what he saw in me. But. He taught me a lot about. Working with exotic animals. And, uh. He showed a lot of confidence in me. And which. And. Also built confidence in myself. Mm-hmm. And, uh. Sort of let me know that, you know. There's nothing that I really can't accomplish if I put my mind to it. So. You know. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. It was. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. I'm going to go back to the room. Okay. So. You're welcome. Okay. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks so much for coming today. Oh. Yeah. And, um. Um. What? It was.
