[00:08:02] SPEAKER_01: It's been a few years.
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_01: But I still feel the same as I did when they diagnosed me.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: So I assume I'm still depressed.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: What got you to tell it?
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_01: Uh, well, I just, I'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: So I just thought that would be a good idea.

[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: we can't afford good therapy, but just even talking to friends, I would consider therapy,
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_01: somebody who'll listen, so helps you get stuff off your chest. Thanks.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_01: How did you get into the profession?
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_01: Well, I haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se, but when you talk to somebody who listens,
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_01: and you get stuff out there, like out of your head or whatever, it helps to de-stress, I think.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_01: What are some things that you would put in your book?

[00:10:18] SPEAKER_01: Just dumb mistakes I made when I was younger that, looking back now with what I know now,
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_01: I probably would not have made.
[00:10:29] SPEAKER_01: What advice would you give yourself as a person who doesn't know?
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_01: I would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_01: Who's someone that's been a positive influence on your life?
