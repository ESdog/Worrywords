[00:07:14] SPEAKER_01: Just always feeling down and out, clinging myself in, not wanting to be bothered with the outside world.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_01: Just little mood swings and just can't sleep at night.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_01: All kind of little stuff that kind of got me feeling like something wasn't right about me.

[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: No.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: Is going to a therapist helping you?
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_01: It is.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_01: Very much so.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_01: Tell me more about that.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_01: The reason why I feel like it's helping me is because the lady who I see there at the
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_01: therapy place, she's very nice.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: She's willing to help out in any way she can.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: She's almost to me like a psychiatrist.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_01: She's very good.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: I mean she talks to me about things, encourages me what not to do, what to do to help calm
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_01: down, to feel better.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: and she's just very nice all in all. I always leave there confident all the time.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_01: What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy?
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_01: Number one, my mood swings. I've noticed a big change in that and my attitude.
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_01: Okay. How has staying there affected you?
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_01: It affected me in a great way. I would never say negative because, like I said,
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_01: it goes back to the helpfulness that I've received from the lady and from the therapist
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: and the different ways I was coached on how to improve my lifestyle to avoid the problem
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_01: that I do have right now I suffer with. So that's how it affected me that way.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_01: Okay. What were your symptoms?
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_01: The attitudes, the mood swings, couldn't sleep at night,
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_01: depressed all the time.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_01: No outside company at all. Didn't want to be bothered with anybody, friends or family,
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_01: locked up in my room all the time. Halfway not wanting to eat or overeating. It was just a lot.
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_01: Are you triggered by something?
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_01: Maybe like any little thing would trigger me off. Like somebody could say something wrong to me
[00:09:43] SPEAKER_01: that I would think was wrong and would just trigger it. I would just get triggered and just
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_01: snap for no reason.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_01: It's just, I don't know what cost it besides that.
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_01: That's great.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_01: How do you cope with that?
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_01: Well, now I'm coping with it by not snapping as much and just trying to stay calm.
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_01: I just need a lot of positive environment around me, not negativity.
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_01: That helps too. So with that being said, I just kind of maintain
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_01: and keep my high self-esteem. I just keep my high self-esteem. I just keep my high self-esteem.
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_01: I just keep my high self-esteem. I just keep my high self-esteem.
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_01: I'm not trying to come up as much as I can.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_01: Nice.
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_01: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_01: A lot better than before.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: That's good.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_01: Have you ever studied change in your behavior or thoughts lately?
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_01: Yes, I have. Very positive thoughts. Very positive behavior.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_01: Much better than what it was. Very big improvement from before.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_01: Do you feel that way often?
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_01: Yes, I have been for the past few months.
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_01: I've been feeling a little better.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_01: Do you feel down?
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_01: I have at times, but today, no.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_01: I'm feeling pretty upbeat.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_01: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_01: It's not very easy, but I try.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_01: But for the past few nights, I have been sleeping the full night.
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_01: So, that's a positive for me.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_01: What do you like when you know sleep well?
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_01: Very cranky, very groggy, moody.
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: When was the last time you felt really happy?
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_01: Actually, yesterday.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_01: I received some good news over the phone.
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_01: And I was happy the whole day.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_01: I'm still kind of happy about it today, too.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_01: So, that was very good for me.
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_01: That's good.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_01: How would your best friend describe you?
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_01: My best friend is a male.
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_01: He would probably describe me as upbeat, always ready to go, love to eat, just a fun person to be around.
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_01: Is there anything you regret?
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_01: No, I don't regret anything.
[00:12:18] SPEAKER_01: But everything that's happened versus the past and the future is a bit closed-off.
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_01: I would heartbreaking, though.
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: 
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: Thank you for moving on.
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_01: Bye.
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_01: Goodbye.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_01: Goodbye.
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_00: Bye-bye.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_00: Goodbye.
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_00: That was awesome.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_00: Was it?
[00:12:55] SPEAKER_00: I love it.

And I was happy the whole day. I'm still kind of happy about it today, too. So, that was very good for me. That's good. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend is a male. He would probably describe me as upbeat, always ready to go, love to eat, just a fun person to be around. Is there anything you regret? No, I don't regret anything. But everything that's happened versus the past and the future is a bit closed-off. I would heartbreaking, though. Thank you for moving on. Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Goodbye. That was awesome. Was it? I love it.
