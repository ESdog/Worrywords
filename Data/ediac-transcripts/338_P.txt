[00:01:39] SPEAKER_00: How did you decide to do that?
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_00: Well, I've always worked with children ever since I was 18 years old.
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_00: So I figured doing something, helping someone, it doesn't pay well, but you're investing in the future.

[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: I'm kind of quiet, but I also like, I probably would say borderline.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: I like outside activities, but I mainly kind of do activities probably by myself.
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_00: So yeah, I would say I'm in general.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_00: I'm a little introvert.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: Slightly.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: What are some things that you do?
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_00: Oh, wow.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_00: Just maybe a racist or disrespectful person.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: What do you do when you're in life?
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_00: I kind of shut down and reevaluate how I am as a person, how I'm coming off to other people.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_00: I can't change anyone else's personality.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_00: But I can work on my own.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your own self?
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_00: I'm pretty good.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it like now?
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: I usually don't argue with people.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: I usually walk away.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_00: I mean, an argument doesn't settle anything.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: Is there anything you regret?
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: Wow.
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_00: That's a lot of things I regret, but it's not anything that I can control.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_00: Probably the biggest regret was losing my mother.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00:

[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: I was happy.
[00:03:36] SPEAKER_00: We had a problem yesterday, and my brother was
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_00: who made me do this.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_00: Who taught me how to use the books, and now I didn't know how to do that.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, three years ago, I listed I haven't paid five dollars or anything in my life.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_00: I love you up front.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: And no record in the whole time.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_00: He called me and told me And when I solved it, I'm watching.
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_00: control. I would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_00: Okay. When do you think it's going to get fixed?
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_00: I think that's pretty cool. I think you should have different avenues to deal with different people.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_00: Okay. Have you ever served in the military?
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: No, I have not.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_00: No, I have not.
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_00: How long ago were you diagnosed?
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_00: Less than a month.
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_00: What got you into this job?
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: I realized I have to evaluate myself as a person, so I can't really look to anyone else to help me unless I start with myself.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: Do you still go to therapy now?
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_00: No, I don't.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_00: Why did you stop?
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: I feel like as a person, as an individual, I feel like I should be able to control things myself.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_00: I feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else. It probably is very good for other people.
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_00: I've worked with that population of PTSD veterans before, so I know that it helps a lot of people, but I don't feel like it's for me.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_00: How hard is it?
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_00: It's not difficult at all.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_00: I've always been like a loner, someone who tries to handle my own problems and situations.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_00: How do you feel about it?
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: A little depressed, but I think everyone has a little bit of sadness in them at some point.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_00: How do you cope with that?
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_00: Day by day, day by day. I just started an exercise program, so I'm trying to look at myself for the solution.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: Did you think you had a problem before you found out?
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_00: Always known. Ever since I was a child, things moved me differently than other kids, so I felt like I was always different.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: I felt like if I was going to ever understand me as a person, then I would have to work on myself.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you felt you really had to work on yourself?
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_00: Today. I got to see my best friend after a long time.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_00: I mean, happiness comes and goes, but I felt happy today.
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_00: That's great. How were your best friends?
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_00: Wow, he would say really silly, but still, when I'm around him, I try to be happy.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_00: I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy. No one wants to be around a depressed person.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: How do you know them?
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: I'm a little bit of a person who's always been a little bit of a person.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: I'm a little bit of a person who's always been a little bit of a person.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: What would you say is your best quality?
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: Wow. I mean, on certain days, everything could be my best quality, but I would say I'm loyal. I'm dependable.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: I would just say I try to be there in the moment.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: I'm not a person who is really flashy or into materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded.
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_00: What's your sister's company?
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: Oh, my mother. By far, my sister.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_00: My mom was a schoolteacher, which made me want to become a schoolteacher, and that's basically what I have been doing.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_00: My sister has been at her job for 40 years.
[00:07:49] SPEAKER_00: So I've always had a stable influence in my life.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_00: What's your most memorable experience?
