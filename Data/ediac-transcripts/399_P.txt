[00:00:48] SPEAKER_00: As far as my parents, Ethiopia.

[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: The beach.

[00:01:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_00: I see what you mean.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_00: What do you study at school?
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm currently in school.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_00: I'm studying African Studies.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_00: Cool.
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_00: How did you decide to do that?
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_00: I've always been interested in African Studies.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: Actually, I've always wanted to help people.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_00: And I figured that I could help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_00: and make an influence.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_00: That's great.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_00: Can you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_00: Kind of in between.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_00: I have my shy moments, but then when I'm around a group of people that I enjoy, I'm pretty
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_00: outgoing.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on this vegetarian screen saver.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_00: Hey, I know it's not for everyone.
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_00: I'm from Hawaii.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_00: But it's the best I've got.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_00: What do you do to relax?
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_00: To relax?
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_00: I normally write or I go to the beach and just sit there and play my guitar.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: Pretty good.
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_00: I don't really get angry or anything like that.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_00: I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you argued with someone?
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_00: And what was it about?
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:31] SPEAKER_00: The last time I argued with someone was when I was in high school.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: I actually can't remember the last time I argued with someone.
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_00: What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_00: All the people I've hurt in the past.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_00: Well, I've like cheated on people, hurt their feelings intentionally, tried to make them
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_00: done things I shouldn't have done that I regret now.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_00: Well, with my ex, I could have ended it better,
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_00: so we could be on better terms now.
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: I probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:04:03] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about that.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: Um, well, he had a tumor that he had to get removed,
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: because he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_00: But just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_00: That sounds really hard.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about your relationship with him.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_00: Me and my family aren't very close.
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_00: We don't, I mean, they've always been there for me, and I appreciate it,
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: but we've never had that close connection, especially since they're foreign,
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_00: so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from,
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_00: having been grown up out in America.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: So it's pretty different when it comes to racial, I mean, the cultural boundaries
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: that we kind of step each other's feet on.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: But aside from that, we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_00: It does get kind of awkward, but.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_00: It's okay.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_00: What do you think of the new kids?
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: I think they are out of control.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_00: I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_00: I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing.
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_00: And I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_00: I feel like they're being applauded by the media.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_00: They're being applauded by celebrities that they follow.
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_00: And there's not enough being done about it.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: And they're just getting lost.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_00: It depends on the night.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_00: Some nights it's pretty hard.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: Some nights I fall asleep like a baby.
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_00: Usually creative, actually.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_00: When I can't sleep, I'll just stay up and I'll write something or I'll read a book,
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_00: and ideas will pop up.
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_00: Stuff like that is usually hard.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_00: It's usually a good thing when I can't sleep.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: It's nothing really bad because I'm having bad thoughts or anything like that.
[00:06:05] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: Lately, between a mix of good and bad.
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_00: I have my happy moments where I'm energized and I'm alive.
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_00: And then some days where I'm just sitting there, just mellow, thinking, not like my live self.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_00: It's just always been like that.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: I always have those ups and those downs.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: But they kind of balance each other out.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: The last time I felt really happy was today.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: Tell me more about that.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_00: Just from the moment I woke up.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: It was a beautiful sunny day.
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_00: I went to see some friends.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: We had a good time.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: Went to school.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: Had some good grades on some papers.
[00:07:09] SPEAKER_00: Wrote a good essay.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: I feel pretty accomplished.
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_00: And I feel like my day is just a good day.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_00: That's so good to hear.
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_00: How would your best friend describe you?
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: My best friend would describe me as odd.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: Most people would describe me as odd.
[00:07:31] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_00: I say a lot of odd things.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_00: I do odd things.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: I'm interested in things that most people aren't.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_00: Like what?
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: Just like old literature.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_00: Revolutionary stuff.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: Stuff about changing the world.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_00: But through understanding.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: And understanding what underground means.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: Is there anything you regret?
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_00: No, I don't live a life of regret.
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_00: What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_00: To never let fear stop you from doing anything.
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_00: Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: Reading, hanging out with friends, driving around, finding something to do, just going
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: on an adventure.
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_00: I don't wish I could change anything about myself.
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: I just wish I could build myself into the person I'm truly supposed to be.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself.
[00:08:49] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: I was a little kid.

[00:08:59] SPEAKER_00: How I've hurt people.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: How I've hurt her.
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_00: The ways I've done them that were brutal.

[00:09:14] SPEAKER_00: my parents

[00:09:28] SPEAKER_00: once it happens I learn from it and I'm like oh that's what my parents told me
