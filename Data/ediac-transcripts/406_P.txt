[00:01:31] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure you can tell by my shoes.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm not much of a world explorer.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_00: Do you travel a lot?
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_00: No, I haven't really traveled in about five years.
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_00: Why?

[00:01:48] SPEAKER_00: I just haven't traveled.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_00: What do you enjoy about traveling?
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_00: I like going to new places.

[00:01:59] SPEAKER_00: I like seeing things I haven't seen before.
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_00: And if I can, like visiting places like landmarks.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_00: I'd love to hear about one of your trips.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_00: Well, the last one I did was San Francisco.
[00:02:13] SPEAKER_00: That wasn't so far.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: But I got to stay in downtown San Francisco, and I got to go shopping.
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_00: And I got to get on the streetcar.
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_00: So that was cool.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_00: Nice.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: What did you study at school?
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_00: Well, I still study.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: I'm studying psychology.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: That sounds interesting.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_00: How did you decide to do that?
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_00: Well, I decided to go back to school just pretty quickly.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_00: So I went to junior college.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_00: And then when it got close to graduate, I knew I wanted to transfer.
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_00: So I'd taken a couple of psychology courses, and I decided I liked it.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_00: So I just decided to make that my major.
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_00: And I thought it didn't have a lot of math, but it had enough math.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: Are you happy with it, though?
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: Well, now that I'm almost done, I don't know if I'm going to continue in that area.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: I understand.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: What's your dream job?
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: Well, what I wanted initially was to get into sports psychology.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_00: But I'm not quite sure that's what I want either.
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_00: Can you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: Well, I could be shy initially, but once you get to know me, I'm outgoing.
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best-saved guy.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_00: What do you do to relax?
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_00: Uh.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: I think I either go to sleep, eat something really, really good, or watch something on Netflix.
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_00: Like what?
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: Well, just a good movie.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_00: I like foreign movies a lot.
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_00: So a lot of, right now I'm into martial arts movie with subtitles, so.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_00: Cool.
[00:04:19] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your hunger?
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm pretty good.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you argued with someone?
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_00: You know, I know they're not really long arguments.
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if they're real arguments.
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_00: I know I argued with my boyfriend because he hung up on my face.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: I don't know why.
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_00: And it got solved pretty quickly.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: So I don't know if it was really that important.
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: Wait.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: I walked out without saying.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_00: You wish you were able to differently.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_02: I can't think of one right now.
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: I think the hardest decision I probably had to make was moving from, well, back to California,
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_00: from Oregon.
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: Well, I was really young.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: So I was 19, 20-ish.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_00: And I was really by myself.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_00: So that was pretty hard because I obviously had to support myself.
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_00: And what made you decide to do that?
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_00: Because it was really, really boring in Oregon.
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_00: So I really liked the activity here in LA.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_00: I see what you mean.
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_00: What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:06:12] SPEAKER_00: You know, I don't really feel guilty about many things.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about your relationships with your family.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't talk to them that much.
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_00: My dad, my stepmom live in Oregon.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: So I probably talk to them on the phone at least once or twice a month.
[00:06:34] SPEAKER_00: And then when they come out here, I want to say at least once a year.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes it can be twice, you know, occasionally more, but not too often.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_00: Then I see them.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_00: That's about it.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: But I'm pretty much the only one out here.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: My brother is also up there as well.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: And what's your favorite person in your life?
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_00: Just someone that's been a positive influence in your life.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: Well, I've had lots of positive influences, I think.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: Just regular people I come across, you know, maybe someone I've worked with.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_00: Maybe, oh, actually my uncle.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: He's a really good positive influence.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: He knows quite a bit, has lots of good advice.

[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: About life.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about New Balance or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: You know, I don't really think I've had anything that bad happen to me where I just don't,
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: where it bothers me so much I have to not think about it.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: Pretty, well, I can't say pretty easy because I work a hot schedule and then I go to school,
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: but, yeah, if I want to go to sleep, I sleep really well, though, as long as I have enough,
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_00: you know, hours.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
