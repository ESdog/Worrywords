[00:07:10] SPEAKER_01: couldn't really move.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_01: So that was the only downfall.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_01: Besides that, I brought my New Year in great with tons of friends and that's how it's supposed

[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: Once we got into the real mountains and got on real mountain bikes, I gained a new respect
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_01: for the mountain bikers.
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_01: It was fun and pretty intense.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_01: Going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense.
