[00:01:40] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_00: I haven't.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_00: I've only been out of the country once.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_00: Or a few times, actually.
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_00: But only to one other country.
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_00: I'd love to hear about one of your trips.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_00: Well, they were when I was younger, before I turned 21, and we used to go to Tijuana
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_00: across the border just to get into nightclubs and stuff like that.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_00: What do you enjoy about traveling?
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: Well, I love to see new things, new places, and have new experiences.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: Cool. What did you study at school?
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_00: After high school, I went to beauty school for cosmetology.
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_00: How did you decide to do that?
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: Well, at the time, I was looking for a career change,
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_00: and I was looking for a job.
[00:02:40] SPEAKER_00: I have some friends in the industry, and I decided to take classes and see what I thought.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_00: Are you still doing that?
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_00: Only as a hobby.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_00: What's your dream job?
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_00: Well, that's a tough one to answer. I'd have to think about that.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_00: I would be on the outgoing side.
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_00: Just because I'm more outgoing than I am shy.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank's green saver.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: Hey, I know you're a fish tank.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_00: I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_00: What do you do to relax?
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_00: A lot of times I smoke marijuana.
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_00: Cool. How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_00: Not the best.
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_00: I had an argument with my mother over how we should handle doing things with my grandmother.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: Well, we just had differences on who should do what at what times and who's in control.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_00: I should pretty much let her follow her rules because she's her daughter.
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_00: How did you feel in that moment?
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: Well, it's okay. I understood. We talked it out and realized that I might have been overstepping my bounds.
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about your relationship with your family.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_00: It's fairly good. I am pretty close with my mom and my grandmother.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_00: I have a stepfather and a half-brother.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_00: We get along okay, but we're not very close.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_00: And I've never met my real father.
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_00: What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_00: Maybe not accomplishing as much as I should have in my life up to now.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_00: Have you done anything to avoid it?
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: Uh, yeah, maybe...
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: By not having enough ambition or drive to be in a better position in my life.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_00: Well, one of the hardest decisions was when I moved away from Los Angeles to Wisconsin.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_00: Tell me more about that.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_00: Well, when I was younger, I was getting in trouble and I was looking for a way out so I wouldn't continue getting into trouble.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_00: And I...
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: With a friend, we just packed our bags and moved to Milwaukee.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_00: Wow.
[00:06:45] SPEAKER_00: Are you happy you did that?
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_00: Wow.
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: Uh...
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_00: Extremely difficult.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: I guess, uh...
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: I got a lot of things going on...
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_00: Or not going on.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_00: And it just makes it hard for me to sleep.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: Like what?
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_00: Issues in my life.
[00:07:17] SPEAKER_00: And, uh...
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this?
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00:

[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: I guess it depends on what I have to do.
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: Do you feel down?
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_00: Right now?
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_00: A little.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: Well, in the last few minutes since we started talking about depressing stuff.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm starting to feel a little more down.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: I haven't.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: Do you have disturbing thoughts?
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: Very seldom.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: How do you cope with them?
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: Just stop thinking about them.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_00: Are you triggered by something?
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_00: I couldn't answer that right now.
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_00: Um...
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_00: I...
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: I guess I felt, it's been a while since I've been really happy.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: I don't have a whole lot of very happy thoughts as recently.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_00: Well, let's see.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_00: I did go to Las Vegas a couple months ago.
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_00: I had a good time there.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_00: What would you say are some of your best qualities?
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm an honest person.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_00: For the most part, reliable.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm easy to get along with.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about an event.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_00: Or,
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_00: something that you wish you could erase from your memory.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_00: Wow, where do I start?
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_00: I have plenty of bad decisions I could erase.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_00: Can you give me an example of that?
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, I have a DUI on my record.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: How hard is that?
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_00: Uh, well, for the time it's suspended my license, it makes life extremely difficult.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me about that?
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_00: Well, yeah.
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_00: It's hard to get around when you can't drive legally.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: And if you do drive illegally, you're at risk of going to jail.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_00: For driving with a license.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_00: Without a license.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: Has that gotten you in trouble?
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_00: Uh, well, the original charge did, but I haven't got caught driving since.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_00: How would your best friend have grabbed you?
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_00: I don't have a best friend.
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_00: Oh, I see.
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_00: I see.

[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:11:37] SPEAKER_00: What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_00: Mmm, maybe that I could follow through with some of my plans.
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: Be a little more ambitious.
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_00: Maybe not.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_00: Some of the decisions I've made in my life I have regrets.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_00: Take care of business first and always handle your responsibilities.
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_00: What are some things that usually put you in a good mood?
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure.
