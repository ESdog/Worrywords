[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: Cause I was so scared

[00:03:29] SPEAKER_00: pretty girls, the ocean, a lot of things.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_00: What are some things you don't really like about the life?
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_00: Smog, excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with.
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_00: I would like to travel more.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: Seeing new things and learning perhaps a new culture or something.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay. When I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing.
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_00: Backpacked around Europe for a little while and it was real fun.
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: What's one of your most memorable experiences?
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: Probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: What did you study at school?
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_00: Well, I have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in, or for business as well.
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_00: What do you do now?
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_00: Now I look for work. I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: Okay. What's your dream job?
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_00: It would probably be to own my own company.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_00: That's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push forward with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working on.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_00: I would say middle of the road. A little bit shy and at times can be, takes a while to warm up.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_00: I'm just cautious to meet someone new and then from there,
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_00: kind of see where to go from there, I guess.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about your relationship with your family.
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_00: My family, they still live in Colorado. They're interesting people and good as well.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: I talk to them probably a couple of times a week. They're good people.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_00: I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and he's married as well.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank's screensaver.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_00: Hey, I know it's not malign, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax?
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_00: That's a good question.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: Lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike.
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:07:43] SPEAKER_00: For the most part, pretty good.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable, I try to stay away from people,
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: How are you at controlling your temper?
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_00: because I don't like to go off on people. They didn't do anything wrong or change me.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_00: the topic in my mind, I guess.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_00: What gets me in trouble would be more
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: I avoid things and it kind of builds up
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_00: and becomes worse and that kind of gets
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_00: the trouble, yeah.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: What was it about?
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_00: Basically just in a relationship,
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_00: working with a girlfriend.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: And to be honest with it,
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_00: I don't remember exactly what it was about.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_00: It's just probably one of us is being irritable
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_00: and me and going from there.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_00: Or it's probably a lot to do with money as well.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_00: I don't have,
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_00: I don't have the best financial security at this point.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about a situation
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_00: that you wish you would handle differently.
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_00: What's something you feel guilty about?
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_00: That's a good question.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_00: I guess I do harbor a little bit of guilt
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_00: from the military as far as getting out.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_00: And people are stealing, I suppose.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_00: But no, that's not for me anymore.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: Anymore?
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the hardest decision
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_00: you've ever had to make.
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_02: Hmm.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_02: Tell me about an event
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_02: or if something happened that you wish
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_02: you could erase from your memory.
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: .
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_00: Let me think.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_00: Well, I used to work for a friend
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_00: and I invested into his company
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: and the economy went down.
[00:10:37] SPEAKER_00: It was a construction accessory company basically.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_00: And economy went down and we lost most of our money
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_00: like most of the folks around America.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_00: And that pretty much, it was a good and bad thing.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: I guess you gotta look at it.
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I guess you gotta look at it
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_00: from a good perspective,
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_00: but I definitely put myself in a tailspin financially
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: and couldn't really do anything about it.
[00:11:02] SPEAKER_00: Almost was homeless for a little while.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_00: But I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_00: and just moved forward and perhaps gone to school
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_00: like I'm going anyway.
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_00: Anyway.
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_00: Sadly, for about half an decade now,
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_00: I've been talking to my nunca over Sayulee
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_00: wanting to work in life,
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_00: Or the History Month which I truly ya,
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_00: when she её died,
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_00: when she knew she was on the suivre of a movie she was on.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_00: And that was kind of a escri push.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: So I wanted to know the story behind that.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: And to match up with my cousin思�ifies
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_00: andああong look what Emma says in this company because
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_00: even me, the first victim I ever knew
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: serve my country and also the added benefits of going to school were nice. I didn't have
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_00: much financial capabilities at that time.
[00:12:06] SPEAKER_00: And I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought.
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_00: Are you happy with that?
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, I'm very happy I joined the military. I appreciate it now more that I'm out
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_00: and understanding kind of what I suppose war was about is definitely changing people and myself as
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_00: well.
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_00: Did you ever see combat?
[00:12:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I did.
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well.
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life?
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: Um, I'll let's see. I thought at first it was very easy
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_00: and then I came to understanding it was very difficult.
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_00: Just because I was
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_00: adjusting from military life and still having that in my head
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_00: and not until now I realized that probably just a few months ago
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_00: to you know reintegrate myself a little bit better
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_00: into civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult.
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry you're doing that.
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_00: no problem.
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_00: How did you get out of the military?
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_00: Let me think.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_00: When I got out of the military,
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_00: first is I invested, like I said,
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_00: into my friend's company,
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_00: and we started that little business.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_00: We were doing well for a little while working
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_00: and then lost all of our money.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_00: And then I traveled for a little while,
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_00: which I understand now is obviously some other issues,
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_00: but I traveled all over America working
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_00: and went to school in New York for a little while,
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_00: lived in a few different states,
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_00: and came back to California,
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_00: where I'm finishing.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_00: School, finally.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_00: Living the dream.
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_00: How did serving in the military change you?
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_00: That's a good question.
[00:14:58] SPEAKER_00: I would say,
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_00: well, it instills you with very good, I think,
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: a sense of character and strength.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_00: And, you know,
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_00: I think there's a lot of good qualities
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_00: that the military, our military puts into people,
[00:15:18] SPEAKER_00: but at the same time,
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_00: it puts a lot of bad qualities as well,
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: because you need some sort of edge
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_00: or something that you need on an almost daily basis.
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_00: And if you don't get that,
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_00: then, you know, a lot of guys, you know,
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_00: turn into drinking or drugs
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_00: just because you can't get that same edge.
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_00: And that really, that can really either hurt or benefit you.
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_00: How have you been feeling lately?
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_00: I've been feeling okay.
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_00: I've had a bit of a sinus issue lately,
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_00: but I've been feeling okay.
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_00: Have you had a study in New Zealand
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_00: that you've had a talk with you?
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_00: Actually, yeah.
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_00: I've done a lot of research.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_00: My thoughts, I used to really have scattered thoughts.
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_00: And I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better clarity,
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_00: which is good.
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_00: I'm taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that,
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_00: and it's actually helped.
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_00: How easy is it for you to get a good experience?
[00:16:45] SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure.
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_00: It varies.
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_00: I can't really.
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_00: The tough part for me is the schedule
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_00: because that's if I'm not tired,
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: you don't sleep, you just lay there.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: It's hit or miss, really.
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_00: Some nights I can sleep pretty well.
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_00: Some nights I have to wait until I'm exhausted.
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_00: And I don't like doing pills.
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_00: Why?
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_00: Pills are bad.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_00: I understand that.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_00: But it's basically just can't sleep
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_00: because either my mind's always thinking about something
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_00: or something I feel that I have to do,
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_00: but yet I'm not doing anything.
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_00: That's not true.
[00:17:40] SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to always do something.
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_00: Or, yeah, I mean, I do have some troubling dreams at times,
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_00: but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping.
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_00: It wakes me up is what it does
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_00: because it can be the dream that you remember
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_00: versus the one that you don't.
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_00: What are you like when you don't sleep well?
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_00: When I don't sleep well,
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_00: well,
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: perhaps irritability and anxiety definitely go up.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_00: I definitely get,
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_00: I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: And not sleeping very well
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_00: definitely puts that into the mix.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_00: Have you ever been diagnosed with dyslexia?
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_00: I have.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_00: Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_00: Not that I know of, no.
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_00: When was the last time you felt really happy?
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_00: When I was in high school.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_00: I try to feel happiness on a daily basis, I guess,
[00:19:26] SPEAKER_00: would be a good answer, but I'm not certain.
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_00: That's good.
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_00: Who's done what's been a positive influence on you?
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_00: I'll say my dad's been a very positive influence.
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_00: How are your best friends around you?
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_00: That's a good question.
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_00: Charismatic.
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_00: A fun guy.
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_00: Pretty tough.
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_00: Probably a good worker.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_00: How about something you did recently that you really enjoyed?
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_00: I'd say I really enjoyed, um, jogging.
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_00: The other day on the beach.
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_00: You did?
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_00: What are you most proud of in your life?
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_00: I'm proud of my family.
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_00: 
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_00: Um.
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_00: Something that I am most proud of.
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_00: I would say I'm actually, uh, an online minister as well, and I married my brother and his
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_00: wife, and that was a pretty proud experience.
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_02: I think I've asked everything I need to.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_02: Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_02: I appreciate it.
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_02:

Cause I was so scared pretty girls, the ocean, a lot of things. What are some things you don't really like about the life? Smog, excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with. I would like to travel more. Seeing new things and learning perhaps a new culture or something. Oh, okay. When I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing. Backpacked around Europe for a little while and it was real fun. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that. What did you study at school? Well, I have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in, or for business as well. What do you do now? Now I look for work. I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business. I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree. Okay. What's your dream job? It would probably be to own my own company. That's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push forward with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working on. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I would say middle of the road. A little bit shy and at times can be, takes a while to warm up. Why? I'm just cautious to meet someone new and then from there, kind of see where to go from there, I guess. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My family, they still live in Colorado. They're interesting people and good as well. I talk to them probably a couple of times a week. They're good people. I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and he's married as well. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank's screensaver. Hey, I know it's not malign, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? That's a good question. Lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike. I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike. I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike. I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike. How are you at controlling your temper? For the most part, pretty good. I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable, I try to stay away from people, How are you at controlling your temper? because I don't like to go off on people. They didn't do anything wrong or change me. the topic in my mind, I guess. What gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse and that kind of gets the trouble, yeah. What was it about? Basically just in a relationship, working with a girlfriend. And to be honest with it, I don't remember exactly what it was about. It's just probably one of us is being irritable and me and going from there. Or it's probably a lot to do with money as well. I don't have, I don't have the best financial security at this point. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. What's something you feel guilty about? That's a good question. I guess I do harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out. And people are stealing, I suppose. But no, that's not for me anymore. Anymore? Mm-hmm. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. Okay. Tell me about an event or if something happened that you wish you could erase from your memory. . Let me think. Well, I used to work for a friend and I invested into his company and the economy went down. It was a construction accessory company basically. And economy went down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America. And that pretty much, it was a good and bad thing. I guess you gotta look at it. I mean, I guess you gotta look at it from a good perspective, but I definitely put myself in a tailspin financially and couldn't really do anything about it. Almost was homeless for a little while. But I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just moved forward and perhaps gone to school like I'm going anyway. Anyway. Sadly, for about half an decade now, I've been talking to my nunca over Sayulee wanting to work in life, Or the History Month which I truly ya, when she её died, when she knew she was on the suivre of a movie she was on. And that was kind of a escri push. So I wanted to know the story behind that. And to match up with my cousin思�ifies andああong look what Emma says in this company because even me, the first victim I ever knew serve my country and also the added benefits of going to school were nice. I didn't have much financial capabilities at that time. And I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought. Are you happy with that? Yeah, yeah, I'm very happy I joined the military. I appreciate it now more that I'm out and understanding kind of what I suppose war was about is definitely changing people and myself as well. Did you ever see combat? Yeah, I did. I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? Um, I'll let's see. I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understanding it was very difficult. Just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realized that probably just a few months ago to you know reintegrate myself a little bit better into civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult. I'm sorry you're doing that. no problem. How did you get out of the military? Let me think. When I got out of the military, first is I invested, like I said, into my friend's company, and we started that little business. We were doing well for a little while working and then lost all of our money. And then I traveled for a little while, which I understand now is obviously some other issues, but I traveled all over America working and went to school in New York for a little while, lived in a few different states, and came back to California, where I'm finishing. School, finally. Living the dream. How did serving in the military change you? That's a good question. I would say, well, it instills you with very good, I think, a sense of character and strength. And, you know, I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military, our military puts into people, but at the same time, it puts a lot of bad qualities as well, because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on an almost daily basis. And if you don't get that, then, you know, a lot of guys, you know, turn into drinking or drugs just because you can't get that same edge. And that really, that can really either hurt or benefit you. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling okay. I've had a bit of a sinus issue lately, but I've been feeling okay. Have you had a study in New Zealand that you've had a talk with you? Actually, yeah. I've done a lot of research. My thoughts, I used to really have scattered thoughts. And I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better clarity, which is good. I'm taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that, and it's actually helped. Okay. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good experience? I'm not sure. It varies. I can't really. The tough part for me is the schedule because that's if I'm not tired, you don't sleep, you just lay there. It's hit or miss, really. Some nights I can sleep pretty well. Some nights I have to wait until I'm exhausted. And I don't like doing pills. I'm sorry to hear that. Why? Pills are bad. I understand that. But it's basically just can't sleep because either my mind's always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do, but yet I'm not doing anything. That's not true. I'm trying to always do something. Or, yeah, I mean, I do have some troubling dreams at times, but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping. It wakes me up is what it does because it can be the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't. What are you like when you don't sleep well? When I don't sleep well, well, perhaps irritability and anxiety definitely go up. I definitely get, I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches. And not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix. Yes. Have you ever been diagnosed with dyslexia? I have. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not that I know of, no. When was the last time you felt really happy? When I was in high school. I don't know. I try to feel happiness on a daily basis, I guess, would be a good answer, but I'm not certain. That's good. Who's done what's been a positive influence on you? Um. I'll say my dad's been a very positive influence. How are your best friends around you? Um. That's a good question. Charismatic. A fun guy. Um. Pretty tough. Probably a good worker. How about something you did recently that you really enjoyed? Um. I'd say I really enjoyed, um, jogging. The other day on the beach. You did? Yes. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud of my family. Hmm. Um. Something that I am most proud of. I would say I'm actually, uh, an online minister as well, and I married my brother and his wife, and that was a pretty proud experience. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. I appreciate it. Bye-bye. . . All good. She said goodbye. It's all right. She's very understandable.
