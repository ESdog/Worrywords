[00:00:23] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_02: Alright.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_02: I was born in Los Angeles, California.
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_02: Well, the weather and the fact that people aren't so obtrusive like on the East Coast.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_02: Just the...
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_02: the traffic and the smoggy weather.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_02: I used to. I'm unemployed now, so I rarely go anywhere.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_02: I have a BS in business with a computer option.
[00:01:26] SPEAKER_02: I thought that the only place I could get a job
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_02: with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_02: So I took that. I took the business computer methods option.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_02: I'd probably be like a professional sports player or an actor.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_02: Something that you enjoy doing.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_02: I like to ride my bike.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_02: I like to watch sporting events.
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_02: Now I can't afford to go to them.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_02: So I pretty much watch on TV.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_02: I like to travel, but like I said, I don't have money for that anymore.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_02: That's alright.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_02: People who are chicken heads, they get their nose in other people's business,
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_02: even if they're just strangers.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_02: You expect that from a family member or a friend,
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_02: but you know, especially with the internet, that feeds a lot of that now.
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_02: We know what Orwell was referring to when he spoke to Big Brother in 1984.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_02: I don't do much different than I would otherwise.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_02: How long did it take you to come home from the country?
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_02: I've had many temper outbursts.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_02: That's good.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_02: When was the last time you argued with someone?
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_02: What were you about?
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_02: I kind of argued with my aunt.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_02: And it was because she was basically making leading statements,
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_02: trying to trap me into saying something about a relative.
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_02: And it annoyed me greatly.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_02: How close are you to your family?
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_02: I'm kind of on the outs with my parents.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_02: Why?
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_02: Kind of the black sheep.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_02: I understand.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_02: Who's done the most bit of positive influence in your life?
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_02: Well, I mean, my mom's done the most to help me.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_02: She's done a lot, you know, more than anybody by far.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_02: Tell me more about that.
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_02: Well, I mean, she's just...
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_02: I remember one time when I was like 13,
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_02: I went with a friend of mine to see the Crosley Stills National Young concert at the Forum.
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_02: And she has seven kids.
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_02: And she picked me up at the Sizzlers right across the street from the Forum at 11 o'clock at night.
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_02: And I couldn't imagine, with all she had to do that day, that she agreed to do that.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_02: But she did.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_02: 
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_02: What's one of your most memorable experiences?
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_02: Oh, probably going down to the Cape at the end of the Baja Peninsula,
[00:04:38] SPEAKER_02: the Cabo San Lucas,
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_02: or photographing the Bridal Veil Falls in Yosemite.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_02: How did you feel in that moment?
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_02: It was probably the two most majestic sights I've ever seen.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_02: That sounds like a great experience for me.
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_02: It was, when I could afford to travel.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_02: Have you ever served in the military?
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_02: Have you ever been diagnosed with depression?
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_02: Have you been diagnosed with depression?
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_02: I was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in April of 2011.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_02: And I took some Lexapro, but I stopped after one day.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_02: I didn't want to do it anymore.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_02: Do you still go to therapy now?
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: Why did you stop?
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_02: Because I didn't feel it was helpful.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_02: I feel I was becoming a zombie.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_02: That's tough.
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_02: How have you been doing lately?
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_02: I'm depressed about not having a job for over two years.
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_02: I lost my job in October 2010.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_02: And except for, you know, jobs like this,
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_02: which I'm fortunate to get, just, you know, daily things,
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_02: focus groups like that, I haven't worked.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:06:00] SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_02: It can be tough because I'm a good zombie, too.
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_02: Especially when you're 56 years old.
[00:06:06] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_02: Have you ever said you're a zombie?
[00:06:14] SPEAKER_02: Well, it's just, it's just, I guess, a general feeling of hopelessness.
[00:06:21] SPEAKER_02: How do you cope with that?
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_02: I get out on my bicycle a lot.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_02: I walk or bike four hours a day.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_02: About two hours each.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_02: That's nice.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_02: How do you get to sleep?
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_02: Very easy.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_02: Because now I'm old.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_02: When I was younger, I couldn't sleep more than four or six hours a night.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_02: Why?
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_02: Because I'm restless.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_02: Are you hurt by something?
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_02: No.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_02: But now that I'm old, I sleep much more easily.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_02: That's good.
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_02: I pray before I go to sleep.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_02: And that's when I can't have any trouble sleeping.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_02: I just pray.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_02: Recite different prayers, like the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary,
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_02: stuff like that, and I'm able to fall off to sleep.
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_02: When was the last time you felt very impacted?
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_02: Probably, I can't have any specific remembrances of that.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_02: You know, it was when I had money to spend, I know that,
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_02: and when I had to have a job to have money to spend.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_02: So it was probably 15 years ago.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_02: How about something that you really enjoyed?
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_02: Well, I haven't really enjoyed anything.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_02: Last week I made $75 on a job with the county, basically.
[00:08:05] SPEAKER_02: It was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel,
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_02: and they enlisted people to play.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_02: Basically, the relatives of people who had been in a fall bombing at the Staples Center,
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_02: and we asked questions, signed up, gave them information on our missing relatives,
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_02: and basically it was provided by the county,
[00:08:32] SPEAKER_02: and basically went through a routine in downtown L.A.
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_02: How hard is that?
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_02: Not hard.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_02: It was just a routine we had.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_02: We had to follow.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_02: We had to act like we were actually missing somebody
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_02: and had to give the specifics of their characteristics, height, weight, etc.
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_02: How are your best friends friendly?
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_02: I don't have a best friend.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_02: What would you say is your best quality?
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_02: I'm very bright.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_02: I'm a perfectionist at my job.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_02: I'm a perfectionist at my job.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_02: I'd say that's about it.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_02: What was your biggest challenge when you were in the Army?
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_02: I got a business degree, and I've never been a motivated person.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_02: I went to school.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_02: I went to two state colleges and two junior colleges to meet that end,
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_02: so I believe that was probably the most significant contribution that I made to my,
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_02: you know, to my, I guess, self-esteem, you might say.
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_02: So I had something to hang on the wall.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_02: That's great.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_02: Is there anything you regret?
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I regret, you know, alienating family members.
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_02: What advice would you give yourself as a family member?
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_02: I would have basically not been so impetuous and left jobs thinking that, you know,
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_02: I could always get another one.
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_02: And not, you know, basically blow off jobs.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_02: I could probably work at one of the employers that I used to work for now.
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_02: They've added locations, but I've burned bridges there, so that's not possible.
[00:10:25] SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_02: I think I've asked everything I need to.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_02: Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.
