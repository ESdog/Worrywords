Host: There are only a few moments left in the life of this program, News & Notes. It's never saying goodbye, but I have been a journalist working on television and radio for a lot more years than I care to say. And in that time, I have been a part of shows that have come and gone for various reasons. This has been special. Special because of what we do, where and how we do it and most importantly because of you, our listeners. You have helped us to prove, to not only NPR, but to a lot of others that there is a place for the unique perspective that News & Notes brings. Is what we do profitable for the company's bottom line? Who knows. Is what we do valuable? Of course. I want to thank NPR for at least giving us the opportunity to come to you each day, each night on air and online. They took some risks. That should be acknowledged. And so did we. Finally, let me say thanks to a great staff of young people committed to getting the job done. I will miss them, each and everyone, and we will miss bringing this show to you. But it's true, nothing lasts forever. So, I'm Tony Cox and this, for the final time, is News & Notes.
