Host: All right, here's a little bit of radio fiction. We're calling it a Two-Minute Noir. Any guy would gladly give up his life for her. She's Angelina, angel of death.
Guest: They say her name was Angelina. Angel of Death. They say she emanated a scent that attracted men. Like a moth. To a candle. Like a fly. To honey. You got stuck. Or you got burnt. Angelina was beautiful. There's plenty of beautiful things, but how many are worth dying for? She loved playing with men. Like a cat with a mouse. Artie jumped off a bridge. Ciao. Antonio drove his Ferrari into a tree. So long. Aaron blew his brains out. And that's just the ace. And then there was the B's. Barney, Buck, and Bert. Poor sap. They didn't stand a chance And then came the C. Charlie, Chet, and Chaz. She was a kiss of death. They say, God, could she ever kiss. Pucker up and die. She collected souls. Like a bounty hunter. For the devil himself. Angelina. Angel of death. Pucker up and die. And then one day, she met soulful Sammy. Soulful Sammy. They say he carried the weight of the world. Sad Sammy. They say hovering above his head was a tarnished halo. She wanted his soul. Angelina emanated her sweet scent. She wove her spell. She kissed his sad soulful lips. His halo fell to the floor. Along with the weight of the world. And Sammy rose up into the air. Or so they say. And Sammy floated away. And Angelina? She picked up his tarnished halo. She tucked it in her arm, and she went away. And the weight of the world? Others came. They swept it up and carried it away. Or so they say.
Host: That Two-Minute Noir was produced by Thomas Lopez and comes to us from the NPR series Hearing Voices.
