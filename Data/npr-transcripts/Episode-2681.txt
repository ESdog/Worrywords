Host: Good morning. I'm Noel King. 1969 was a really big year. There was the moon landing, Woodstock, and the people of Derry, N.H., made a time capsule. This year, library staff cracked it open to see what was left behind.
Guest: We were a little horrified to find that there was nothing in it.
Host: The town's library director Cara Potter told TV station WMUR that no one had a list of what was supposed to be in the capsule. And now she wonders if it was empty all along. Trippy.
