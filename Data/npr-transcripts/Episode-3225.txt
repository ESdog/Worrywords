Host: From NPR News, this is News & Notes. I'm Farai Chideya. Today is Thanksgiving Day. Some of us spend it with friends and family, others volunteering, and yet others using it as a day of reflection. We asked some people what they were going to do this year. Unidentified Man #1: Thanksgiving holiday, thanking the Lord for allowing me, for one thing, to wake up and see another Thanksgiving, and thankful for breathing on this earth. And because when you wake up in the morning, it's a blessing to be alive. So that's the first thing, praising God. And just relaxing a little bit, watching some football and going over family and friends and enjoying a nice meal.
Guest: You know, standardly, I don't do anything. I used to do the traditional thing years ago. But I - gosh, I haven't - I don't think I've eaten a traditional meal in years. I'm a vegetarian now, so that's kind of changed things for me. Probably just do the, you know, normal, social thing in the (unintelligible), you know. There's always a drum circle during the holidays, so I'll probably partake in that. Unidentified Man #2: Mainly, I'm just going to be thankful. I usually look at that holiday as just a time for families to mesh together. You know, I have my own issues about it, but you know, mainly it's a good time for people just come together and kind of embrace each other and help each other. So mainly, like our family, we just get together, and we could have a little food. But now, with the Barack Obama election, you know, maybe this time Thanksgiving will be something more of like trying to build something more positive for our communities.
