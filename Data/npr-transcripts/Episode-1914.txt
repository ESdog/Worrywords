Host: The blogosphere is in a twitter - literally. They've been twittering about something that happens today. They've been twittering about for weeks. 6:31 p.m. Eastern Time is a very, very special time for computer nerds: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0 o'clock in Unix time. Unix is the system that measures time on your computer. You can practically see the excitement on Darrell Silver's(ph) face.
Guest: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0 day is this way of celebrating this thing that you have to be an absolute geek to know about or even further even care that it exists. It's a fun way to be connected with a host of other geeks around the world.
Host: And in case you're wondering, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0 o' clock means 1.2 billion seconds have passed since Unix time began in 1970.
