Host: OK, now, we're back with slate.com's John Dickerson. We just heard from the West, John, and Latinos played a big role there. How decisive?
Guest: Well, in some states, let's say New Mexico, Latinos went for Obama 69 to 30. So that was quite decisive. And in Colorado, it was also a decisive victory, 73 to 27 for Obama. You know, thinking back to the primaries, there was a question at one point about whether Barack Obama would be able to appeal to Latinos. This was sort of one of the great problems he was supposed to have. And he seems to have solved that problem rather decisively.
Host: Now, let's talk about white voters. That was also a big question mark. And he did get a firm portion of white voters, the largest share of white support of any Democrat in a two-man race since 1976. But still more white voters went for McCain.
Guest: One of things that Obama was able to do is shrink that margin. Republicans tend to do better with white voters and have traditionally done better. So, it's not surprising that they went to the Republican. What's important for Obama as a governing matter is that he was able to shrink that margin, that he doesn't seem to have a quote, unquote "problem" with those kinds of voters. Again, this was a big issue during the primaries and in the general election, and, in fact, among younger white voters, he did quite well.
Host: Thanks, John, and we'll have more with Slate's John Dickerson in Chicago, including who may be running Obama's White House, who his chief of staff may be. That's all coming up when Day to Day continues.
