Host: Good morning. I'm Rachel Martin. Admit it, at least once in your life, have you hung up on a telemarketer? Donald Sizemore actually managed to find a way to get the telemarketer to hang up on him because Donald Sizemore does a very good Donald Duck. And this is how he answered the call.
Guest: (As Donald Duck) Oh no. Am I in trouble? Am I in trouble? Hello?
Host: After a while, the telemarketer decided it wasn't worth it anymore and ended the call herself. Well played, Donald, well played.
