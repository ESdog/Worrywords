Host: Good morning. I'm Noel King. Cambridge engineers wanted to set a record for most people playing a piano at the same time. A standard piano has 88 keys, so how about 88 people? The Daily Mail reports the engineers had school kids design long mechanical fingers to make this possible. Every kid played a single key. And they performed a composition called "88 Pianists."
Guest: (Playing piano.)
Host: Sounds like a record.
