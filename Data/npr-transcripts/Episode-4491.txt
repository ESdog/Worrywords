Guest: (Singing) Ground control to Major Tom.
Host: Good morning. I'm Rachel Martin. It's been 50 years since David Bowie released his seminal album "Space Oddity." To honor the anniversary, Mattel Toy Company has come out with a Bowie Barbie that channels the pop icon's alter ego Ziggy Stardust. She's got the red mullet, gold makeup and the iconic metallic spacesuit - a bizarre tribute, yet oddly perfect.
