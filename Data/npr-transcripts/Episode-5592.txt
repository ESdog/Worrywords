Host: This is Day to Day. I'm Madeleine Brand and back now with Slate's John Dickerson. And, John, there are so many interesting observations coming from these exit polls about how people voted in this race.
Guest: Indeed, there are. One of the things that Senator Obama did is, he beat back a lot of the questions that had popped up after the primaries about his ability, about the role of race, about his ability to appeal to voters at the lower end of the income scale, white voters, Latino voters. There was a question at one point whether he'd be able to do very well with them. And so, a lot of these mysteries we've been puzzling over in the last many months, now, we finally have some data that gives us some clue about how it all turned out.
Host: And yes, Latinos turned out for him in force, 66 percent to 32 percent for John McCain.
