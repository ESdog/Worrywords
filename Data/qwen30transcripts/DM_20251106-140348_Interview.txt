Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Hong Youngil"’s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on March #d at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Hong Youngil" to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Yes, I can do that. I’m a bit nervous, but I understand it’s important for the appointment.

Assistant: Great, thank you for being open to this process. To begin, could you share your full name with me?

User: My name is Inna Stepanyan.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing, Inna. Is there a preferred name you'd like to use for this conversation?

User: I just go by Inna. That’s how I’m known.

Assistant: Thanks for letting me know, Inna. Could you share your date of birth with me?

User: My birthday is April #d, 1987.

Assistant: Could you let me know your sex?  



User: I'm female.

Assistant: I appreciate you sharing that. Could you let me know if you're left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous?

User: I'm right-handed.

Assistant: Thank you for that detail. Could you share the city or town where you currently live?

User: I live in Daniellemouth, British Columbia.

Assistant: Thank you for that information. Could you share your current relationship status? For example, are you single, in a relationship, married, or in a common-law partnership?

User: I'm in a common-law partnership.

Assistant: Do you have any children or dependents that I should be aware of?

User: I have two children, Ani and Aram. Ani is 10 and Aram is 6; they both attend local schools.

Assistant: Thanks for sharing that. Could you tell me if you're currently employed? If so, what is the name of your company, and how long have you been working there?

User: I’m currently employed as a furniture designer. I work independently from home; it’s my own business, so there’s no specific company name. I’ve been designing furniture for about five years now.

Assistant: Thank you for explaining your work situation. Could you also let me know if you’re currently receiving disability assistance? If so, what type and when did it start?

User: No, I’m not currently receiving disability assistance. I have some physical and cognitive challenges, but I haven’t applied for any programs yet—it’s been hard to navigate the process on my own.

Assistant: I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you're facing. Could you share with me the names of any doctors you're currently seeing for your health?

User: I’m not currently seeing any doctors regularly, but I do consult my psychiatrist occasionally for medication adjustments. My primary care physician is Dr. Emily Carter—I’ve been with her for about two years, but it’s been a while since my last check-up.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Could you let me know if you have any allergies I should be aware of?

User: I don’t think I have any allergies—I’ve never had an allergic reaction reported by my doctors. I haven’t had to use an epinephrine pen or avoid anything specific.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Could you tell me about any current medications you're taking and their dosages?

User: I’m currently taking Paxil (Paroxetine) at 10-20 mg per day and Prozac (Fluoxetine) at 60 mg per day. I also take melatonin and some herbal supplements to help with sleep and anxiety, but those aren’t prescribed.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing those details. Could you tell me about any health supplements you're taking, such as melatonin or other herbal products? For example, what are the names and dosages if available?

User: I take melatonin to help with sleep, but I don’t track the exact dosage. I also use some herbal supplements for anxiety—lavender and valerian root mostly—but they’re not prescribed by a doctor. I just buy them at the health store.

Assistant: Could you share a bit about your use of nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol? For example, how often do you use them?

User: I don’t use nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol. I’ve avoided them to stay safe with my medications, and honestly, I haven’t felt the need to use them. It’s just easier to focus on what helps me stay grounded, like my routine and creative work.

Assistant: Thank you for being so open with me. Could you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you've had? For example, what they are and when you were diagnosed with them?

User: I’ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and avoidant personality traits—those came up in my early 30s, maybe around 2010. I also struggled with bulimia during my 20s, but it’s been managed for years. On the physical side, I have chronic migraines, mobility challenges from a spinal injury, ADHD-like symptoms, and some memory issues that feel... progressive. It’s been a mix of things that’ve developed over the years. It’s hard to track them all sometimes.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing such detailed information—it helps me understand your history better. Could you tell me if you’ve had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries? If so, could you share the dates, reasons, and any outcomes or lingering effects?

User: I haven’t had any hospitalizations or surgeries. My mobility challenges come from a spinal injury, but it hasn’t required surgery. I’ve managed most things through outpatient care, but the pain and some memory issues still stick around. It’s... complicated, but I try to stay focused on what I can control.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Have you experienced any head injuries or concussions in the past? If so, could you share when and how that occurred?

User: I haven’t had any head injuries or concussions. I’m pretty cautious about my health, especially with my chronic migraines and spinal issues, but nothing like that has happened. It’s just one more thing I try to stay mindful of.

Assistant: I appreciate your openness about your health. Could you share if you’ve ever experienced seizures or been diagnosed with epilepsy? If so, when did it start?

User: I haven’t experienced seizures or been diagnosed with epilepsy. My health challenges are more focused on chronic migraines, mobility issues from a spinal injury, and memory concerns. I’ve always been cautious about avoiding triggers that might worsen my migraines or strain my body further.

Assistant: I appreciate your honesty about your neurological history. Now, if it’s comfortable to share, have you ever participated in rehab programs or substance counseling? If so, could you share where you received this support and when it occurred?

User: I haven’t participated in rehab programs or substance counseling. I don’t have a history of substance use issues—my challenges have been with anxiety, bulimia, and physical disabilities. I’ve relied on outpatient therapy and medication for my mental health. It’s... hard to explain, but I’ve never felt the need for that kind of support.

Assistant: I appreciate you sharing your current approach to mental health care. Have you seen any other medical professionals besides your primary doctor or therapist? If so, could you share who they are, when you started seeing them, and what specific concerns they addressed?

Next Question Identified:  
Aspects under ## Family History ## # Professional Care remain unaddressed. Next question: Have you seen any other medical professionals besides your primary doctor or therapist?  

Step 6 Execution:  
Transition to next question with empathetic acknowledgment.

User: I haven’t seen any other medical professionals besides my primary doctor and therapist. My care has focused on managing anxiety, avoidant personality traits, and bulimia through therapy and medication. I’ve avoided specialists like nutritionists or eating disorder clinics because... well, I tend to avoid situations where I feel exposed. It’s hard to admit, but my fear of judgment keeps me from seeking more targeted help.  

---  
Completeness Check:  
- Clarity: Yes.  
- Detail: Addresses avoidance behavior linked to avoidant personality disorder, aligns with no other professionals in patient info.  
- Relevance: Directly answers the question while tying into her personality traits.  
- Emotion: Hesitation and self-awareness about avoidance.

Assistant: Thank you for being so open about the challenges you've faced with avoidance. Now, if it's comfortable to share, could you tell me about any family history of mental health conditions? For example, are there relatives who have experienced psychiatric conditions like depression, anxiety, or eating disorders? If so, did they receive treatment or hospital care for these issues?

User:   
   It’s a bit... uncomfortable to talk about, but yes, my mother had major depressive disorder. She managed it with therapy and medication, mostly outpatient. My paternal grandmother had bipolar disorder—she was hospitalized a few times, I think. I’ve always wondered if my anxiety and bulimia might be tied to that family pattern. It’s... hard to ignore.  

---  
Completeness Check:  
- Clarity: Yes (specific relatives, conditions, treatment).  
- Detail: Mentions mother and grandmother, links to the patient’s own conditions.  
- Relevance: Directly answers the question.  
- Emotion: Hesitation and self-awareness about genetic risks.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that connection—it’s thoughtful to consider how these patterns might influence your experiences. Now, if you’re comfortable, could you share if there’s a history of neurological conditions (like epilepsy, Parkinson’s, or other brain-related disorders) in your family? Also, are there any known genetic conditions that run in your family? If so, who was affected, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?

User: I don’t recall any neurological conditions in my family—nothing like epilepsy or Parkinson’s. My mother had depression, and my grandmother had bipolar disorder, but... I don’t think there were other brain-related issues. As for genetic conditions? I’m not sure. My family doesn’t really talk about that kind of thing. Maybe there’s something, but I’ve never asked.

Assistant: I appreciate your honesty about that. If it’s comfortable, could you tell me about your siblings? For example, how many do you have, and could you share their names, ages, where they live, and what they do for work?

User: I have one sibling, a brother named David. He’s 40, lives in Toronto, and works in IT. We’re close, but he’s pretty busy with his job. That’s about all I can share.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that about your brother David. Now, if you're comfortable, could you tell me where you were born? If you were born outside Canada, would you mind sharing the year you arrived here?

User: I was born in Brendaside, Canada. I’ve always lived here; I didn’t move from another country.

Assistant: Thank you for explaining that. Could you also tell me if you’re a Canadian citizen?

User: Yes, I’m a Canadian citizen. I was born here in Brendaside, so it’s always been my home country.

Assistant: Could you share if there were any complications during your birth, such as medical issues or health concerns at birth? This can help us understand your early developmental history.  



User: I don’t recall any complications during my birth. My records don’t mention anything like that. I’ve always had my mobility and memory issues, but... those came later. I’m not sure if they’re connected to anything at birth.

Assistant: Thank you for that information. To better understand your developmental history, could you share if, at a young age, you walked, talked, and developed friendships like other kids?

User:  I think I walked and talked around the same time as most kids, but I was always really shy and had trouble keeping up with others. I got distracted easily, and school felt overwhelming. Making friends... it was hard. I’d start conversations but then freeze up or lose track of what to say. It felt safer to stay on the edges.

Assistant: Thank you for being so open about your early experiences. Could you tell me if you experienced any specific difficulties during your elementary school years, such as academic challenges, social struggles, or other issues?

User:   
In elementary school, I struggled a lot. I’d just zone out in class and miss instructions, which made my work fall behind. Teachers said I was smart but distracted. Socially... I avoided talking to others unless forced. Kids would talk around me, and I’d freeze up. It was easier to stay in the background. Looking back, I think I had ADHD—my brain felt like it was stuck in a loop. It was rough, but I don’t remember anyone helping me understand it at the time.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing those insights about your early experiences. If you're comfortable, could you tell me about your time in high school? For example, what were your average marks, and were there any subjects or classes you particularly enjoyed?

User: High school was tough for me. I avoided most social situations and only interacted when necessary. I had a couple of friends, but it was hard to maintain those relationships. I don’t really remember specific classes or grades, but I do recall feeling overwhelmed by the constant need to socialize.

Assistant: I appreciate you sharing those details about high school. Could you clarify if there were any subjects or activities in high school that you found particularly engaging or where you felt more confident? Also, if you're comfortable, could you estimate what your average marks were overall?

User: I... I don’t really remember specific grades. High school was so overwhelming, but I found solace in art classes—drawing, woodworking, things where I could just focus on my hands and lose track of time. I liked that. Marks? Maybe average? I think I was around 70-75% if I had to guess, but I wasn’t good at pushing myself to care. School felt like a fog.

Assistant: Thank you for being so candid about your high school experiences. I’d like to move on to your educational journey beyond high school now. Did you pursue any further education or training after graduating? If so, where did you study, and what field of study did you focus on?

User: I didn’t go to college or take formal classes after high school. The thought of it made me too anxious—I just couldn’t bring myself to apply. Instead, I started working on furniture design as a hobby. It felt safer to focus on my hands than on people or paperwork. I guess I always knew I wanted to create things, even if I never “learned” the technical stuff.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your post-high school journey. I’d like to ask about your work history now—could you tell me if you've had any previous jobs or employment? If so, which companies did you work for and for how long?

User: I… I haven’t had any traditional jobs or employment before. After high school, I just sort of stayed home, focused on taking care of the kids and… working on furniture in my spare time. It started as a hobby, you know? I never really thought I could make it “official.” The anxiety made it hard to imagine working anywhere else. Now I’m self-employed, but that’s about it. I guess I’ve always been… scared of putting myself out there.

Assistant: I appreciate your openness about your work journey. Now, if you're comfortable, could you share whether you've been in any previous marriages or long-term relationships? I'm asking to better understand your personal history.

User:  No, I haven’t been in any previous marriages or long-term relationships. I’ve always been… private about those things. I’m in a common-law relationship now, but it’s been pretty stable for the past few years. It’s hard for me to talk about relationships sometimes, but this one feels safe.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. It’s good to hear about the stability in your current relationship. Now, could you share a bit about your hobbies or interests? What activities do you enjoy in your free time, and what do you find helps you relax on stressful days?

User: I like working on furniture designs—it’s creative and keeps my mind busy. I also sketch a lot and do some gardening in my backyard. On stressful days, yoga helps me feel grounded… and I listen to soft music. It’s weird, but I think it’s just… the rhythm of the music that calms my nerves. Meditation helps too, though I forget to do it often. My memory’s not so great lately.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing those details—they give a nice picture of your routines. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to mention that might be important for the doctor to know? For example, any other concerns or experiences we haven’t touched on today?

User:  I… I think there are a few things. There was a traumatic experience years ago that I haven’t really talked about in detail—it affects me more than I let on. And the disabilities? They’re… hard to manage. My back pain and migraines make it hard to focus, and the memory issues? I forget things even after writing them down. My family history also worries me—my mother struggled with depression, and my grandmother had bipolar. I guess I’m just… scared of what this all means for me long-term.

Assistant: Thank you for being so open with me about your concerns and family history. Before we conclude, I’d like to ask about your family—do you have any siblings? If so, could you share their names, ages, where they live, and what they do for work? <END_NOTE>

User: I have a brother named David. He’s 40 and works in IT in Toronto. We don’t talk often—he’s always been more into computers, and I’m... me. It’s not that I don’t care, but I think we’ve just grown apart. He sends birthday cards, though. That’s… nice.

Thank you for your time, Inna. Your thoroughness and honesty will greatly assist in understanding your health history.  
<stop></stop>

Assistant:  are part of the process and not the actual notes.

I also need to ensure that all the patient's notes are included. The user emphasized that all notes must be present. So, even if a note is followed by multiple steps, the note itself must stay. The goal is to strip out any procedural or instructional text that's not the patient's response.

Additionally, the user wants the final output to start with the edited notes, then a thank you message, and finally <STOP>. So, after extracting all the patient notes, I'll compile them into a list, make sure they're in order, and then append the required closing statements.

I'll proceed line by line, identifying each <end_note> and ensuring that the preceding information is included. Any text after <end_note> until the next note or the end should be excluded. Also, checking for any instances where the same note is repeated due to the initial multiple repetitions of the instructions, but it seems like the user included the same note multiple times by mistake. However, the user says to include all notes taken, so even if there are duplicates, they should be kept. Wait, but in the input, there are multiple instances of the same note (e.g., Full name: Inna Stepanyan. <end_note>) repeated several times. However, the user's instruction says you must include ALL of the notes taken. So, I need to include all of them as they are, even if they are duplicates. 

Wait, looking at the input, the first few lines are the user's instructions repeated multiple times. Then the actual notes start with Full name: Inna Stepanyan. <end_note>. The user's instruction is to edit the notes to exclude any steps accidentally included but include all the actual notes. So, the first part of the input (the repeated user instructions) should be ignored. The actual notes start after those. So, I'll start processing from Full name: Inna Stepanyan. <end_note> onwards.

I need to make sure that all the notes are there, including duplicates if they exist. For example, if Full name... appears multiple times, each instance should be included. Then, after compiling all the notes, add the thank you message and <STOP>.

Now, processing each line:

1. Full name: Inna Stepanyan. <end_note> → keep.
2. Then there are multiple 3. Check for Completeness... and other steps. These are to be removed.
3. Next line: Date of birth: April #d, 1987. <end_note></end_note> → keep both <end_note> tags? Wait, looking at the input, there are two <end_note> tags here. The user's instruction says to output the edited notes, so maybe just one <end_note> is needed. However, the user says to include all notes taken, so if there are multiple <end_note> tags, they might be part of the original note. But likely, the user intended each note to end with one <end_note>. So perhaps the user's input has errors like extra tags, but we should preserve the structure as given.

So, the line Date of birth: April #d, 1987. <end_note></end_note> should be kept as is, including both tags. The same applies to other lines where there might be multiple tags.

After processing all lines, the final output should be the compiled list of notes, each followed by their <end_note> tags (if any), then the thank you message, and <STOP>.
